# Geographic Lens on Stories (GLOS) Project

This is a multi-phase digital humanities project exploring the conceptual structures and geographic distribution of motifs, themes, and relationships in global vernacular literature, particularly folktales and creation myths.

## üìö Phase 1: Motif and Tale Type Embeddings
In this initial phase, the Thompson Motif Index and Uther Tale Type Index were digitized, organized in a database, and embedded using NLP techniques. A prototype tool was built to retrieve nearest-neighbor motifs or tale types from any input text.

## üåç Phase 2: Creation Myth Structuring and Analysis
This ongoing phase focuses on extracting and modeling conceptual content from 124 creation myths sourced from Barbara Sproul‚Äôs *Primal Myths*. Using JSON-LD representations, ontological classes, and conceptual profiling, this phase supports similarity analysis, clustering, and eventual geographic visualization.
