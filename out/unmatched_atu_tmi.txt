Type Text: The Basil Maiden. (The Sugar Doll, Viola.) A prince (young man) passing by asks a girl who is watering her basil plant (ridiculing her) how many leaves her plant has. The girl answers with a counterquestion: How many stars does the sky have?. The prince does not know the answer and continues on his way ashamed. The next day he returns masked as a merchant (fisherman) and sells something precious to the girl in return for a kiss. Or, the prince repeatedly pricks the girl with a needle; she complains of insect bites. The next day the prince mocks the girl or reveals the deceit (the kiss and the pricking) to her. Next the girl disguises herself as a doctor (death, angel of death), pays a visit to the prince who is feeling sick, and mistreats (mocks) him or makes him believe that death has come to him. Disguised as merchant the girl sells something to the prince on the condition that he kisses his donkey under the tail (his horse's leg). The prince marries the girl, intending to avenge himself by killing her on the wedding night. But she puts a life-sized doll made of sugar (syrup) in her place and hides herself under the bed. When the prince destroys the doll with a sword-thrust and accidentally tastes its sweet “blood”, he regrets his deed. (The girl comes out of her hiding place and they are reconciled to one another.)
