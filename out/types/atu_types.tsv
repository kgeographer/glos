A poor man (merchant, baker) causes a series of accidents: He pulls off the tail of a (borrowed) horse (one of two oxen that he has borrowed dies). The owner sues him. The poor man flees into a house and frightens (hits) a pregnant woman so that she miscarries. Or a woman invites him in out of the rain, and he sits on her sofa and accidentally kills her child. Her husband (the woman) sues him as well. Out of desperation, the poor man jumps from a high tower (bridge) and kills a passer-by , whose brother (other relative) sues him. The injured parties bring the poor man before a judge. The judge decides as follows : The poor man should keep the borrowed horse until its tail grows back. He should impregnate the mother with another child (and her husband should hit her again, to give her another miscarriage). Her husband rejects this settlement and withdraws his suit. (In some variants, he has to pay a fine to the poor man.) The brother (other relative) of the killed man should jump from the tower upon the poor man in order to kill him. He also withdraws his suit. (In some variants he also has to pay a fine to the poor man.). (The poor man leaves with the horse and his settlements.)

In some variants the rich man is angry and tries to kill his brother, but instead he kills an old relative (dead man) who is lying in his place in bed. The poor man takes the corpse away, and convinces an innocent man that he killed the person. This man bribes the poor man not to tell. Then the poor man claims that he had sold the corpse. Cf. Types 1536C, 1537. The rich man kills all his relatives, hoping to sell their corpses. He is put in prison and set free after he serves his sentence. Still angry, he tries to drown his brother. The poor brother, confined in a sack (chest), finds a passer-by (shepherd, rich lord) who is willing to trade places with him. After this person has been thrown into the water, the poor man comes back to the village with the sheep (horse, riches) and claims he found them under the water. The jealous rich man (the villagers) jumps into the water and drowns. Cf. Types 1539, 1737. 
1536	Disposing of the Corpse	Disposing of the Corpse. The motif of having to get rid of a corpse  appears in a series of different narratives. It has different results depending on its situation in the tale. This type combines episodes particularly from types 1536A and 1537. 
1536A	The Woman in the Chest	The Woman in the Chest. A poor brother (neighbor, sexton) steals a hog (cow, food) from his rich brother (neighbor, clergyman). The rich man suspects his brother, but wants to be certain, so he hides his mother-in-law (mother, wife, cook) in a chest (cupboard) in his brother's house to spy. Cf. Type 1360C. The woman confirms the rich man's suspicion and cries out (curses, makes noise). The poor brother opens the chest, strangles the woman (kills her in some other way), and puts some food (cheese, meat, sausage, bread) in her mouth. The rich brother opens the chest, sees that the woman is dead, and thinks she has suffocated. He wants to keep her death secret and bribes the poor brother not to tell any one and to bury her. Later, the poor brother digs her up at night (keeping some of her valuables) and sets her body at his brother's door, where it falls over when the door is opened in the morning. The rich brother thinks the corpse has returned to haunt him . Cf. Type 1537. He pays his poor brother more money to bury the corpse again (often three or four times), but it turns up in the barn, close to the well, on a foal that follows the rich man, etc. The poor man gets so much money (cattle, provisions) for reburying the body that he becomes as rich as (richer than) his brother. 
1536B	The Three Hunchback Brothers Drowned	The Three Hunchback Brothers Drowned. There are two parts to this tale. The first part exists in two forms, but the second part is largely the same. (1) Three hunchbacked musicians are asked by the wife of another hunchbacked man to play some music. (One of the three hunchbacked brothers marries a rich widow, and his poor brothers visit her uninvited.) The husband unexpectedly comes home. The musicians hide in a chest (oven, cellar), where they die  (kill each other). (2) Three monks (clergymen, knights, students) court a beautiful woman. On the advice of her husband, she invites them to visit her. The visit of the first lover is interrupted by that of the second, etc. , and they hide in a chest (oven, cellar). The third lover hides when the husband arrives. The husband kills them in their hiding place . Cf. Type 1730. A drunken man (stupid farmhand, farmer, porter, undertaker, beggar, soldier, the devil) is employed to dump one of the dead bodies into the river (to bury it). When he returns, he finds the second body in the same place as if it had come back from the dead, and then the third. After he gets rid of all three bodies, he meets the hunchbacked husband (another monk, clergyman, knight) and, thinking that this is another revenant, kills him and dumps him into the river (buries him) also. Cf. Type 1537. 
1536C	The Murdered Lover	The Murdered Lover. A woman wants to meet her lover without her husband's knowledge. She asks a neighbor (God, saint) for advice, and is told (by her husband hiding in the church or behind the saint's picture) that she should give her husband a particular food that will make him blind (and deaf). She does so and he pretends to be blind. When the wife receives her lover, her husband finds an opportunity to kill him (and puts some food in his mouth to make it look as if he choked on it). Cf. Type 1380. The husband brings the body of the lover back home (to a shop, inn) and asks in a disguised voice if he may come in. The wife (the shopkeeper) thinks her husband (a drunk) is at the door, and tells him to spend the night with his mistress (to go home). The woman refuses to open the door even when the man says he will die (hang himself). The husband leans the corpse against the door (hangs it on the door). In some variants the woman (repeatedly) has the body delivered to another place where it is “killed” again by someone else (thief, etc.). Cf. Types 1535, 1537. 
1537	The Corpse Killed Five Times	The Corpse Killed Five Times. A certain woman's lover (often a clergyman or a monk) is killed by her angry husband, or a man (clergyman, occasionally a woman) is killed by accident (on purpose, is murdered). The wife (married couple, bystanders, murderer) secretly leaves the body by the neighbors' door. The neighbor thinks it is a robber (adulterer) and “kills” it again. To cover up this murder, the neighbor takes the body to a monastery (and puts it in the abbot's room, or on a toilet), where it is “killed” again because it will not speak . This “murderer” puts the body into a sack and throws it into the river. Fishermen find it and hang it in a shop (put it in a boat or on a sledge, or tie it on a horse and drive it into a field or into a crockery shop), and the shopkeeper “kills”' it again . Cf. Type 1536C. Often the trickster (the first murderer) blackmails the subsequent “murderers” for not exposing their “murders”. Cf. Type 1536A. 
1537*	Corpse's Legs Left	Corpse's Legs Left. A soldier finds a corpse and cuts off its legs. He stays overnight with a rich farmer, and goes away early the next morning leaving the legs. A comrade of the soldier accuses the farmer of murder and blackmails him . 
1538	The Revenge of the Cheated Man (previously The Youth Cheated in Selling Oxen)	The Revenge of the Cheated Man (previously The Youth Cheated in Selling Oxen). A youth (farmer, fool) goes to the market to sell cattle (fowl, eggs). On the way he meets a trickster (monk, robber, landlord, judge) who convinces him that his cattle are not worth very much. He sells (is compelled to sell) them for a very low price . Cf. Type 1551. The youth resolves to revenge himself on the trickster. He disguises himself as a beggar-woman (bride, carpenter, woodcutter, builder) and tricks him so that the trickster lets himself be tied to a tree  and the youth is able to beat him. The trickster goes to get medical help. The youth disguises himself as a doctor and beats him again (in a monastery, bathhouse, robbers' den) . In the end the youth takes his cattle back and also gets some money. In some variants, instead of one trickster, the youth takes revenge on many (seven, twelve, forty). 
1538*	The Jester as Bride	The Jester as Bride. A witty fellow (trickster) dresses himself in his sister's clothes and works as a servant girl (employee) to a clergyman (master). The son of a rich man (mayor) choses him as his bride and prefers him to the priest's daughters, because only he is able to pass a test of feminity (is the cleverest of the girls). On the wedding night a rope is tied to the “bride”s' leg. He frees himself, ties a goat (ram) to the end of the rope, and goes away. Then he returns wearing his own clothes and demands compensation for his sister's having been turned into a goat. In some variants the bridegroom discovers that his bride is a man and leaves town. The groom's parents bribe the “servant girl” not to tell what happened. Cf. Type 1542. 
1539	Cleverness and Gullibility	Cleverness and Gullibility. Three students (butchers, rascals) convince a farmer (fool, trickster) that his cow (donkey, mule, ox) is a goat (hen, donkey), so he sells the animal cheaply . (In variants from southern and eastern Europe, the farmer is persuaded to cut off the animal's horns, ears, and tail in order to get a better price.) The farmer pays in advance at three inns and invites the students to eat with him. Instead of paying, he turns his hat around three times (hits it on the table, throws it on the floor, rings a bell), and the innkeeper says that the bill has been settled. The students buy the hat for a high price. When they try to use it, they discover the trick . (Variants from central Europe end here.) When the students come back for revenge, the farmer pretends to be dead. His wife (occasionally the students) revives him with a stick . (Or, the farmer ties a skin filled with blood under his wife's clothes and pretends to kill her.) He revives her with a “magic wand” (flute, violin, knife), which he sells to the students. The students kill their wives (mothers) but cannot revive them. They put the farmer into a sack (cask) to be drowned, but he trades places with a herdsman who comes by. By pretending to have found the herd of cattle on the bottom of the sea, the farmer induces his greedy adversaries to jump into the water. Cf. Type 1535. In variants from southern and eastern Europe, after the introduction in which the animal is mutilated, the farmer puts coins in the anus of his donkey (horse, cow) or mixes them with its dung. He sells the animal as a gold-producer  (and says that the animal must remain in its stall for two weeks or forty days. The animal dies.). In some versions, the farmer sells his adversaries supposedly-wonderful objects, e.g. a messenger rabbit , a pot that cooks by itself , a pick that locates gold, a rifle that always hits its mark, or a self-propelled sled. Or the farmer promises to teach them to speak Latin and cuts their tongues off . Some variants end with the farmer buried alive. When his adversaries come to rob the grave, he brands them  or cuts off their genitals (noses). 
1539A*	Closing Up the Wine Cask	Closing Up the Wine Cask. A master (landlord) makes up a pretext to send a boy (a farmer) who has offended him to the wine cellar, where the servant is supposed to give him a beating. When the boy sees the servant, he pulls the bung out of the wine cask so that the servant has to use his thumb to close it up. The boy beats him up and runs away, taking bacon (sausage), bread, and a jug of wine with him. Cf. Type 921D*. In some variants, a guest tries to cheat an innkeeper (leaves without paying his bill) who has boasted to him that such a thing had never happened to her. He tells her that he can draw both red and white (any kind of) wine from the same cask. He bores two holes in one cask and tells her to stop them with her thumbs while he goes upstairs to get a glass (some glasses). He leaves and does not come back, so the innkeeper has to wait until her husband comes to rescue her.

Here the fox asks his feet, eyes, ears, and tail how they helped him in his flight. His tail admits that it did not help. As a punishment the fox sticks out his tail and is attacked by dogs . In some variants a hare asks his members about their help in his flight . (Previously Type 160B*.) 
1540	The Student from Paradise (Paris)	The Student from Paradise (Paris). A student (beggar, traveler, clergyman) tells a (foolish) woman that he comes from Paris. She understands this to be Paradise. (Or, he sings, “I come from heaven,” or says he comes from the beyond or is a messenger from hell). The wife tells him that her husband (son) died shortly before. The student claims to have met him in paradise (hell) and tells her that her husband needs certain things. The wife gives the student money (clothes, food, horse, etc.) to take to her husband . The oldest son (brother-in-law, husband) goes after the trickster to retrieve the money. The trickster steals his horse (the son runs his own horse to death) . Cf. Type 1540A*.

The wife gives him the provisions . Cf. Types 1385*, 1463A*, and 1700. 
1541**	The Student Betrays the Shoemakers	The Student Betrays the Shoemakers. A student (Gypsy) orders the same kind of new shoes (boots) from two shoemakers.

1543	Not One Penny Less	Not One Penny Less. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A poor man (soldier, youth) prays to a saint's picture for a certain amount of money, promising to give back double that amount at the end of a month. The sexton overhears and, hoping for the large repayment, gives the poor man what he asked for. The sexton claims to be the messenger of the saint, but the poor man refuses to repay the money to him . (2) A poor man (journeyman, farmhand, sexton, trickster) asks God (a saint) for a certain sum of money, no more and no less. A rich man (master, gentleman, priest, Jew) tests him by giving him (as a joke) 99 (999) instead of 100 (1000) (gold) coins. The poor man accepts them, saying, “Whoever gave me these will surely give me the last one too,” (he counts the value of the purse as the missing coin, adds a coin of his own). He refuses to pay back the money and makes blasphemous excuses (God is old and forgetful, or He cannot count) . Often the tale continues: The lender goes to a judge in order to force the poor man to repay his money. Before the case is tried, the poor man tricks the lender out of his overcoat, shoes, and often his horse. Even the judge is tricked by the poor man, who makes the lender so suspicious that the judge thinks he must be insane. (Cf. Types 1525L, 1642A.)

He tells her that he does not have his curry-comb any more (he had only borrowed it and had to give it back, etc.). She gives him money (he borrows it from her) to go to the market and buy a new one . After he leaves her (is sent away by her father because she became pregnant), she goes after him and asks him to leave her his curry-comb. He pretends to cut off his penis, but instead puts a stone in water and says that that is his comb. She asks a passer-by (monk, her father) to get it out of the water.

The doctor treats him with three capsules filled with feces (puts dung in his mouth). The first restores his sense of taste, after the second, he is able to speak the truth, and when he takes the third, he proves that his memory is good. In some variants, a clever doctor heals a patient by diverting his attention. For example, in a Jewish variant a king has an inflamed eye because he touches it all the time. The doctor tells him that he is pregnant and will give birth in nine months. The king begins to worry about his stomach and touches it: Thus his eye is able to heal. When the birth does not take place, the doctor explains his trick and is made court physician.

Various people call him absurd names, for example, Bird, Hair, Sultry (I Myself, Cat, Cramp) . The different names cause misunderstands that work to the farmhand's advantage: He sleeps with the daughter and wife of his master. When they accuse him, the master does not understand them, and the farmhand continues this behavior. The master knows that the servant has stolen money (other valuables), but because of his peculiar names he is not convicted of the theft. After the farmhand leaves, his tricks are discovered, but he is not apprehended because the people who seek him are ridiculed for calling out his names.

1545B	The Boy who Knew Nothing of Women	The Boy who Knew Nothing of Women. A rich clergyman (farmer) wants a farmhand who will not seduce his daughter(s), and asks applicants about the genitals of a horse (other animal), the procedure of copulation, or the difference between men and women. The boys who know the right answers are not hired. After a time, a youth in disguise comes again pretending that he cannot answer the question(s), and the clergyman hires him. The clergyman calls the wife's and daughter's vaginas prisons, and the youth pretends to be innocent and not to know what they are for. Through other tricks (e.g. using ambiguous names; cf. Type 1545), he seduces the sexually-naive wife and daughter in the presence of the clergyman . For example, in a Russian variant, one night the farmhand tells his employer that he has caught a thief (which is his penis) who should be sent to prison. In the presence of the unsuspecting clergyman, he sends the “thief” into the prisons of the wife and daughter. When he realizes what has happened, the clergyman gets angry and curses the farmhand, thus losing an expensive wager (cf. Type 1000), and has to let him go free.

He tells her that, depending on which rings go in, he can beget a soldier, officer, or general (minister, dean, or bishop). The couple ask him to beget an officer and pay him for his services. While the soldier and the wife are having intercourse, the farmer gives the soldier a push from behind, so that, for the same price, the wife should get a general instead of an officer . Cf. Type 1855A. In some variants the farmer, who is unable to impregnate his wife, initiates the bargain. 
1548	The Soup Stone	The Soup Stone. A soldier (traveler, monk) asks an old woman for food and lodging for the night. She agrees to the lodging but will not give him any food. The soldier offers to show her how to make soup from a stone (nail, ax, horseshoe) (sometimes without the introductory situation). She agrees. While the stone “cooks,” she brings him all that he asks for, one after another: flour, grease, meat (bacon), vegetables, etc. After they eat the soup, the soldier says he is too full to eat the stone (he sells the wonderful stone to the woman) .

A trickster (soldier, student) who would like to buy the sheep cheaply tries to convince the farmer that they are piglets (goats, donkeys). The farmer insists that they are sheep. An accomplice of the trickster arrives and offers to settle the dispute: he proclaims that the animals are pigs. Another passer-by, also an accomplice, agrees. The farmer sells his sheep for the price of pigs . Cf. Type 1538. In some variants, five tricksters one after the other convince a farmer, who is taking his lamb to market, that it is a dog.

This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A man (trickster) continually scratches his head or body (because of a disease) (he sneezes continually). He is promised a reward if he can refrain from scratching (sneezing) for a certain length of time. When he can no longer resist the itching, he tells a story (calls out) in which he can make gestures or sounds that permit him to scratch (sneeze) . Sometimes the listeners realize what he has done, but they reward him anyway because they admire his cleverness. (2) A bald (mangy) man (with head lice), a man who scratches himself, and a man with a dripping nose agree (are ordered, often by the king) not to touch themselves. All of them manage to break the prohibition by telling stories which they illustrate with their forbidden movements. For example, the bald man says that his father bought him a fur cap, and he mimics putting it on and taking it off. The scratching man says his father bought him clothes, and touches himself to show where they did not fit. The man with the dripping nose calls them both liars and points at them by rubbing his nose twice with his fingers. (3) A god offers a prize (his daughter, an ox, both) to whichever animal can clear a field of nettles without scratching himself. After other animals try and fail, a certain animal (spider, Brer Rabbit) wins the prize by disguising his scratching in his animated description of the ox. (4) Two men (a Jew and a Russian) agree not to scratch. Each tries to make the other break the agreement.

(2) On leaving home, a husband tells his wife (wife tells her husband, mother tells her son) to mind (shut or lock) the door, but instead she takes it with her . At night they climb a tree. The door falls, frightening robbers who flee and leave their booty behind . (3) Two (more) brothers exclude their youngest brother from their thieving expeditions because they think he is a fool.

When the king catches a sight of her picture  or of a curl (ring, slipper) which she lost in the sea (river), he falls in love with her and sends out an old woman (witch) to capture her. By a trick the old woman enters the youth's house, learns the secret of the sword , and throws it into the sea. Deprived of his strength, the youth dies, and his wife is taken to the king.

He goes back to the dragon, asks his wife to find out where the magic horse came from, and learns that a certain witch owns one. On his way to the witch, the prince wins the gratitude of three animals which help him to tend the witch's three horses (daughters) that live in the earth, the clouds, and the sea. In payment, the prince choses a scabby foal which turns into a magic horse (with extra legs), and he and his wife flee on his back. The magic horse is the brother of the dragon's horse, and it compells the latter to throw off its rider, the dragon. The dragon is killed, and the prince returns home together with his wife. Cf.

Threatening to kill him, the nobleman takes the dragon's heart, presents it to the king and wins the eldest daughter and the kingdom . The farmer boy and the youngest daughter are sent to live in the goose house. Because there were neither milk nor blood in the dragon's heart, the nobleman, the farmer boy, and the old woman are questioned. Truth comes to light, and the kingdom goes to the farmer boy. (2) During his travels, a workman learns that the sick king can only be cured by a dragon's liver. He sees the dragon's vulnerable spot in a dream. He kills the dragon and boasts of his victory in an inn. The host steals the man's knapsack which, however, contains only a stone. The workman arrives at the king's court prior to the host, cures the king, and wins the princess as his wife. The thievish host is hanged. (3) A father orders his son to bring him the devil's tongue to cure his illness, but the son cannot find the devil. An old man advises him to knock with a stick on a certain trunk. A horse appears and carries him to the devil. The horse gives the son a piece of his hoof which he can use to call it whenever he is in danger. The son challenges the devil, but, during the fight, the devil thrusts him into the earth up to his waist. With the help of the horse, the son defeats the devil, brings the devil's tongue to his father, and thus cures him. (4) While hunting, a prince is bewitched and loses his voice. A young woman appears in his dream and tells him about a remedy: a medicine consisting of dragons' eyes, a dragon's heart and other ingredients, which must be prepared in a certain manner. In return the young woman demands that the prince marry her. After the prince agrees, a youth appears and produces the medicine in the prescribed way.

A man (son of a woodcutter, smith, fisherman, soldier) frees an evil spirit from a vessel (bottle) out of curiosity (because he was asked by the spirit) . The spirit (which stretches out to an enormous height,) wants to take revenge for being locked for so long, and threatens to kill his rescuer. The man tricks the spirit: He pretends he does not believe that the spirit could grow small again and thus induces him to go back into the vessel . The man stoppers the bottle and the spirit is trapped. In some variants, he is released again in return for a gift (wonderful remedy, magic power ). Cf. Types 155, 735A. 
332	Godfather Death	Godfather Death. (Including the previous Types 332A* and 332B*.) A poor man with many children wants a (just) godfather for his newborn son. He refuses God (saint, devil) and chooses death (angel of death, plague) because he treats everyone alike . As a gift the father (son) receives the magic power of forecasting recovery or death, depending on whether death stands at the head or the foot of the sick person's bed . Thus the man becomes a famous doctor and grows wealthy. The doctor betrays death (several times): When promised wealth (the princess), the doctor turns the bed and thus saves the life of a person who was supposed to die  (in the doctor's dying hour, death grants him time to say a last Paternoster, but the doctor does not finish the prayer  – cf. Type 1199. Death tricks the doctor into finishing the prayer.) In some variants, death shows the man his life-light in the underworld and suddenly extinguishes it . Or the man attempts to lengthen his life by various means (usually without success). (Previously Type 332A*.) Cf. Type 1187. 
332A*		
332B*		
332C*	Immortality Won through Betrayal of Death	Immortality Won through Betrayal of Death. This tale exists in two different forms: (1) An old soldier becomes the doorkeeper for heaven. Death asks him several times whom he should take next. God wants death to take the old people (then people in the middle of their life, then young people in succession). However, the doorkeeper wants to save his parents (wife, children), so he tells death instead to fell firs (beech-trees, oaks). God discovers this deception and shows death whom he should take next. Thus the soldier and his relatives are reunited in heaven. (In some variants, the soldier is banished to hell. Here he delivers a number of souls from purgatory and is chased away. Cf. Type 475.) (2) A prince wants to gain immortality. He travels through three different kingdoms, in which the rulers have to perform tasks which must be finished within 600 (800, 1000) years (pulling out a tree, carrying off a mountain, wearing out thousands of sewing needles). During this time death has lost his power. Each time the prince is given magic objects and asked to stay, but he travels on. Finally he arrives at the empire of immortality. After a thousand years he goes to look for his parents. The queen of immortality gives him water of life which he uses to resuscitate the deceased rulers of the three kingdoms. The prince, finding no trace of his former home and family, returns. Pursued by death, he reaches the border of the empire of immortality. In a contest with death, the queen of immortality wins the prince and they live together forever.

Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother's house. (She has to drink the blood, eat the flesh, and lie down in the bed.) Red Riding Hood doubts whether the wolf is her grandmother and asks him about his odd big ears , eyes, hands, and mouth. Finally the wolf eats Red Riding Hood . A hunter kills the wolf and cuts open his belly. Red Riding Hood and the grandmother are rescued alive . They fill the wolf's belly with stones ; he is drowned or falls to his death. Cf. Types 123, 2028. In some variants Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother's house before the wolf. The wolf climbs on the roof to wait until Red Riding Hood leaves. The Grandmother who had boiled sausages asks Red Riding Hood to fill the broth into a big trough in front of the house. Enticed by the smell, the wolf falls from the roof and is drowned in the trough. In an Italian version, a woman who is going to bake cakes sends out her daughter (Caterinella, Caterina, Cattarinetta) to borrow a pan. The lender, an ogre (witch, wolf), asks the girl to bring back some cakes and wine. On her way she eats the cakes, drinks the wine, and replaces them with horse-dung and urine.

The fox uses mud to color himself black and comes back to the bear disguised as a monk . She asks him if he has seen the fox. He asks her if it was the fox who raped her, and she worries that all the animals already know what happened to her. 
360	Bargain of the Three Brothers with the Devil	Bargain of the Three Brothers with the Devil. Three traveling journeymen (brothers, friends) conclude an agreement with the devil: They receive a large amount of money (purse which will never be empty) on the condition that they pledge themselves always to say the same words, “we three”, “for gold”, “that was right” . The host of an inn kills a rich merchant and accuses the journeymen. Because of their stereotyped answers they seem to confess the offence. Cf. Type 1697. The devil rescues them from the gallows .

Out of all (e.g. hare, wolf, ox, fox) who apply, she chooses the fox (hyena). Each time she goes out he eats one of her children, but makes sure that she does not notice that they are missing. After the fox has eaten all of the children, he leaves . In north European variants the mother bear requires that the applicants sing well, and thus chooses the fox. In a few variants the fox and the goose raise their children together and take turns minding them. The fox eats the goslings. (2) The applicants must sing to prove that they would be good hired mourners. While the mourning husband organizes the burial, the fox eats the corpse. (3) Instead of a nursemaid, a shepherd is needed for a herd of sheep. One after another, the sheep are eaten by the fox . (Previously Type 37*.) Cf. Type 123B.

40		
400	The Man on a Quest for his Lost Wife	The Man on a Quest for his Lost Wife. (Including the previous Types 400*, 401, and 401A.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A man in distress (impoverished fisherman, merchant) unwittingly promises his (unborn) son to the devil . When the boy is delivered to him later, the devil cannot use him because he is protected by magic  (cf. Type 810). Thus the boy is cast out in the sea (river, desert). He arrives in a foreign country and finds a lonely castle where he meets a bewitched princess (maiden, fairy) in the form of a serpent (deer). He rescues her by enduring three nights of torture . They marry . When he wants to visit his parents, his wife gives him a ring to carry him home , and she forbids him to call her to come to him  (to boast of her beauty ). At home he is induced (by his mother) to break the taboo. His wife appears , takes the ring, and leaves him destitute. The man sets out in search of his wife . On his way he meets three hermits (rulers of animal kingdoms, or moon, sun, and wind) whom he asks for directions . With the help of the third he arrives at the empire of his wife, or he pretends that he wants to help three giants who are fighting over magic objects (inheritance, booty). He steals the magic objects (magic sword , magic coat or hood , seven-league boots )  (cf. Type 518). With their help he is able to overcome the obstacles on the way to his wife . When he finds his wife, she is about to marry another man . He discloses his identity as her real husband. (2) Meeting the princess and disenchantment as in version (1); but the disenchantment is not complete. The princess wants to travel back to her own distant land. She asks her rescuer to wait for her at a certain time and place. She appears three times, but each time a servant (witch) has put her husband into a deep sleep from which he cannot be awakened . The princess informs him (in a letter) how and where to find her ( on the glass mountain). The man sets out to find her. Continued as in version (1). (3) A youth watches a flock of birds (swans, ducks, geese, doves) land on the shore. The birds take off their feather coats and become beautiful maidens . While they are bathing, the youth steals the feather coat of the most beautiful girl, who cannot leave with the others and thus must marry the youth . Later, because of carelessness (of the man's mother), the maiden takes back her coat  and flies away (together with her children). She tells the youth her destination in the otherworld (e.g. glass mountain). The man sets out in search of his wife (as in version 1). Some variants include elements from Type 313 (Magic Flight). 
400*		
401		
401A		
401A*	The Soldiers in the Enchanted Castle	The Soldiers in the Enchanted Castle. Miscellaneous type. Twelve (seven, three) soldiers (deserters) come (often with the help of an animal or person) to a lonely castle (small house), where they receive food and lodging. A white woman (maiden who appears in a dream) asks them to stay in the castle for seven years (one year and two days) (to keep guard for three nights) and to fulfill certain conditions (not to think of a maiden, not to touch or look at the maidens who sleep in their beds, not to open a certain door). They disobey the prohibition and flee, or all (but one) leave the castle before the end of the vigil. Thus their efforts to disenchant the princesses who live in the castle are unsuccessful . The soldiers often return later, and the one is rewarded (often after having performed different tasks), but the others are killed. In some variants the soldiers succeed in disenchanting the princesses and each of them marries one of them (seven seven-year-old boys finally break the spell) . 
402	The Animal Bride (previously The Mouse [Cat, Frog, etc.] as Bride)	The Animal Bride (previously The Mouse [Cat, Frog, etc.] as Bride). A father is not able to decide which of his (three) sons should inherit his property (kingdom) and sends them all on a quest for one year . They are told to bring back a special object (yarn, linen , fine chain , ring, horse, smallest dog , money) or they must learn a profession. Whoever performs the task best will be the heir. The youngest son, often a fool, goes into a forest and becomes the servant of an animal (cat , rat, frog , mouse ). As a payment he is given the object that his father had asked for. It proves to be the most beautiful one, and thus he should be the heir . Because his brothers (parents) are envious, two further tasks are set, and finally the brothers are required to bring a bride (most beautiful woman ). The youngest returns to the animal which again promises to help. The animal is disenchanted by burning, mutilation, decapitation , or by crossing a river , and becomes a beautiful princess with a castle. They return happily to his parents as bride and bridegroom. Sometimes they deceive the parents: The youngest son arrives dressed in rags and is ridiculed; then the bride arrives and they reveal their identities. When the son arrives in the first place dressed as a prince, a mole helps to identify him. Often the youngest son renounces his inheritance and goes with his wife back to her castle. In some variants from eastern and southeastern Europe and the Near East, the youngest son takes the animal (often a frog or toad) to his home and hides it from the family. The father assigns tasks to his daughters-in-law which the frog performs best. The last (third) task requires the brides to attend a feast, where the frog turns into the most beautiful woman. The bridegroom burns the frog's skin so that the bride cannot change back. As a consequence she leaves him, and he sets out on a quest and finally is able to retrieve her. Cf. Type 400.
402*	The Princess who Scorned an Unloved Suitor	The Princess who Scorned an Unloved Suitor is turned into a frog (mouse, etc.). She is disenchanted (by another man) and her animal skin is burned in order to prevent her from changing back. Cf. Type 400. 
402A*	The Princess Transformed into a Toad	The Princess Transformed into a Toad. A princess who has been transformed into a toad (old witch, etc.)is disenchanted by a young man's kiss (pity) and marries him. Cf. Type 440. 
403	The Black and the White Bride	The Black and the White Bride. (Including the previous Types 403A and 403B.) A stepmother hates her stepchildren . The stepdaughter is kind to someone she meets (e.g. Christ and St. Peter) (she is sent after strawberries in winter , and meets dwarfs who help her). In return she is given great beauty  (the power of dropping gold or jewels from her mouth ). The stepmother's own daughter is unkind under these conditions and is made ugly  (made to drop toads from her mouth ) . The stepdaughter's brother is in service at the court of a king. He takes his sister's picture with him. The king sees the girl's picture, falls in love with her, and sends the brother for her . (The beautiful stepdaughter is seen accidentally by a king or prince, who marries her .) On their journey to the king's court, the stepmother or stepsister casts the true bride out of the carriage (overboard) . The king marries the ugly stepsister , and the brother is thrown into prison or a pit of snakes . (The king's wife gives birth to a child. The stepmother throws her and her child into the water and substitutes her own daughter for the bride .) The true bride is transformed to a duck (goose) , and comes to the king's court three times (to care for her child ). The last night the king wakes and disenchants her by decapitation  (cutting her golden belt, holding her during successive transformations ). The brother, unharmed in the den of snakes , is rescued. The true bride is married or reinstated, and the false bride and her mother are punished . Cf. Types 450, 480, 510B, 511.

404	The Blinded Bride	The Blinded Bride. (Previously Type 533* and part of Type 533.) A girl is blessed at birth by fairies (is kind to a snake) who cause her to produce gold (jewels, flowers) from her hands (mouth , footsteps , tears ). A king sees the girl and wants to marry her. Her wicked stepmother (aunt) and stepsister accompany her on the journey to the king's court. On the way, the girl's stepmother feeds her with salty food. When the girl asks for water, the stepmother puts out both of her eyes  or mutilates her. They take her clothes and throw her into the sea. The stepsister, posing as the bride, marries the king. A kind fisherman (poor man) finds the blinded girl, takes her home, and becomes rich from the gold from her hands. He uses the gold (jewels, flowers) to buy back the girl's eyes  (the snake commands this). The girl recovers her sight, dresses in beautiful clothes, and goes to the king's court. The king recognizes her when she washes her hands. He marries her, and the wicked women are burned. (The snake is the girl's guardian angel and returns to heaven.) 
405	Jorinde and Joringel	Jorinde and Joringel. The lovers Jorinde and Joringel accidentally go to the magic forest of a sorceress (witch). She transforms Jorinde, as she has many other girls before, into a bird  and keeps her in a cage. Joringel dreams about a magic flower, goes on a search, and finds it. He touches Jorinde and all the other birds with the flower and thus changes them back into their former shapes . Cf. Type 442. 
406	The Cannibal	The Cannibal. A couple have a child who is a cannibal  who eats everyone up. A man succeeds in breaking the enchantment , and the cannibal is transformed into a maiden . They are married . Cf. Types 307, 315A.
407	The Girl as Flower	The Girl as Flower. (Including the previous Types 407A, 407B, 652A, and 702B*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A girl (woman, fairy) has been transformed into a flower (twig, bush, tree, fruit) (transforms herself) . A man (her predestined lover) breaks a stalk and the flower changes back into a girl  (he takes the girl in the form of a flower on a journey with him and transforms it afterwards). He marries her  (sometimes her vegetable clothing has to be burned). Cf. Type 652. (2) After a hasty wish, a woman gives birth to a twig (bush, fruit) , plants it in a pot, and cares for it as for a child. A prince is irresistibly drawn to the plant and becomes love-sick . He obtains the plant. During the night a girl comes out of it, eats, and makes love with him. When the prince has to go to war, the girl stays in the plant. The prince attaches a bell to the plant which he will ring when he wants to call the girl. An envious woman (fiancé) signals the girl to come. She appears and is killed, and her plant is destroyed. A compassionate woman resuscitates the girl , and the rival is punished. (Previously Types 407A and 652A. Because of its structural similarity, also the previous Type 702B* is integrated here.) (3) A beautiful girl wants to have a lover, even if he is the devil (a dead man) . The devil comes in the form of an attractive man (with animal feet). She follows him and sees him eating corpses in a church . Several times she is asked whether she had seen anything. She denies this repeatedly, even when the devil kills her sister, mother, and father. At last she herself dies. Because she had made special arrangements for her funeral, the devil cannot find her. Cf. Types 363, 1476B. From her grave grows a beautiful flower (lily, rose, tulip)  which only her predestined husband (nobleman, prince) is able to pick. Because she has to eat, at night she becomes a beautiful woman. Her husband takes her as his wife (often on the condition that he may not talk about her or present her in public, so that the devil will not be able to find her). The couple succeeds in tricking or killing the devil (the devil takes the woman to hell). (Previously Type 407B.) 
407A		
407B		
408	The Three Oranges	The Three Oranges. A prince insolently breaks an old woman's jar (makes her angry in another way). She utters a curse: he is to fall in love with three oranges (lemons, other fruits, girls of magic origin) . The prince sets out on a (sometimes very long) quest during which he is given directions, advice, and help to overcome obstacles. The prince finds the fruits in a garden (castle). When he opens them, out of each comes a beautiful, often naked, young woman who asks for water (comb, mirror, towel, clothes, etc.). The prince can give only the third woman what she asks for, and the other girls die (disappear, return into the fruits). The prince hides the woman on a tree besides a fountain while he goes to get clothes (carriage, company) for her. An ugly black woman (Gypsy woman, witch) comes to get water. She thinks that the reflection of the Orange Girl is her own , and breaks her water jar because she thinks she is too beautiful to carry water. The Orange Girl laughs, and the black woman discovers her. The black woman succeeds in taking the Orange Girl's place (two different versions). The prince returns, and though he is astonished at the sudden change (excuses: sunburn, influences of wind and weather), he marries the false bride. (1) The black woman pushes the Orange Girl into the water , where she changes into a fish  (bird ). The false bride demands that it be killed, but from its remains grows a tree. She demands it be felled, but an old woman (man) takes away a splinter (log) . Out of this once again comes the Orange Girl, who secretly does the old woman's housework. The old woman finds the girl and adopts her. The prince recognizes her when he hears her life history (when the girl tends one of his horses) . (2) The black woman combs (louses) the Orange Girl and sticks a magic needle into her head. The girl changes into a dove  and flies to the castle. The gardener (cook) hears the bird's song asking about the prince and his black wife. The dove is captured and the prince is much pleased with it. He finds the magic needle and removes it, and thus the dove changes back into the Orange Girl . Cf. Type 452B*. After the couple's reunion, the false bride is punished (sentenced to a cruel death; she often pronounces her own judgment).
409	The Girl as Wolf	The Girl as Wolf. An evil stepmother substitutes her own daughter for her married step daughter and transforms the stepdaughter into a wolf (lynx, fox) , which hides in the forest. Every day the wolf comes, throws off her animal skin, and suckles her child (the child is brought to the forest). The child's father observes this, recognizes his beloved wife and (on the advice of a magician) burns her animal skin. Thus she is restored to human form . The stepmother and her daughter are executed . Cf. Type 403. 
409A	The Girl as Goat	The Girl as Goat. (Including the previous Types 413A* and 413B*.) A childless woman wants a child even if it is only an animal.

The sister looks for her brothers and finds out how to release them: She has to be silent for some years  and has to make shirts out of cotton-grass for the brothers . A king finds the young woman in the forest and marries her . In his absence she bears a child, but her mother-in-law takes it away and accuses her of eating the child  (having borne an animal). The young queen remains silent because of her brothers, even though she is to be executed. On her way to the funeral pyre her period of silence ends and her brothers are disenchanted. Everything is explained and the mother-in-law is punished. In some variants the disenchantment of one brother is not complete (he keeps a wing) because the sister cried a tear when her child was taken away (did not completely finish his shirt). (2) A girl finds her brothers in a remote place and keeps house for them. They tell her to take care of the cat (dog), watch the fire, and be careful of the demonic neighbor (ogre, witch). Once she forgets to divide her food with the cat, so it puts out the fire. After the girl asks the neighbor for help, the ogre comes regularly to suck her blood. When the brothers discover this, they kill him. The girl takes flowers (herbs) from the grave of the ogre. Her brothers eat them and they are changed into oxen (sheep, birds). The episode of disenchantment is less important. (3) A mother (father) curses her sons because there is not enough to eat. They are transformed into ravens (swans). The sister seeks for them and asks for directions from the sun, moon, and stars . She finds her brothers on a glass mountain (glass palace). To reach them she needs a little bone as a key (gets help from the wind). She releases her brothers and they go back home. In some variants the episode with marriage and slander follows. Some variants start with the promise of the mother to sacrifice the brothers if a daughter (one more brother) is born . She tries to inform the boys after the birth by a sign , but the wrong sign is sent , so the brothers leave home .

She tells her sorrows to a (little colored) cow (red ox, godmother), who gives her food  and helps her with her work. The stepmother wants to know why the girl is so well fed, and sends her one-, two- and three-eyed daughters one after the other to find out. The girl sings One-Eye  and Two-Eyes to sleep, so they learn nothing, but she forgets to sing to the third eye of Three-Eyes , who tells her mother about the cow . The stepmother determines to have the cow slaughtered. When the girl tells the animal this, the cow tells her to plant its bones (intestines, or not to eat its meat). She does as she was told, and a tree (apple tree) grows which continues to help her . A rich man notices the tree and asks for an apple. When the stepsisters try to pick one, a branch scratches them. Only the girl herself can pick the fruit , and the rich man marries her . Often the tree goes (is taken) with them. The stepmother and stepsisters are punished. Sometimes, the child and the cow run away when the stepsister discovers their secret. They pass through brass, silver, and gold forests .

513A	Six Go through the Whole World	Six Go through the Whole World. A discharged soldier (fool) acquires many (six) traveling companions with extraordinary abilities : e.g. one who runs fast , one who eats great quantities , one who produces (can withstand) severe frost , one who can shoot and hit the left eye of a fly from far away , one with acute hearing , one who can make himself taller, and one who can rip up trees by their roots . In order to avenge himself on the king who discharged him, the soldier enters a contest to marry the princess . She has agreed to marry anyone who beats her at running . The king permits the soldier to employ his helpers. The runner overtakes the princess, but he falls asleep and is awakened just in time by the sharpshooter. In an effort to prevent the wedding, the king assigns other tasks: eating (drinking) a huge quantity , which the eater accomplishes, and staying in an oven , which the freezing man accomplishes. Finally the king offers the soldier as much money as he and his companions can carry  if he will give up his claim for the princess. The companions ruin the king and overcome his army. The same motifs appear together in a reduced form. A prince (young man) is looking for a wife. He takes as servants men who help him accomplish tasks that have been set for suitors who hope to marry the princess . In the end he marries her . 
513B	The Land and Water Ship	The Land and Water Ship. A king offers his daughter in marriage  to whoever can build a ship that can travel on land as well as in water .

The third who answers honestly gets help from the old man and is then able to build the ship (in one night) . The old man also tells him to take with him anyone whom he meets. These turn out to be men with unusual abilities . See Type 513A. When the young man brings the ship, the king is amazed, but since the young man is of humble origin, he gives him further (difficult) tasks to prevent the marriage. The young man accomplishes them all with the help of his companions  (see Type 513A) and marries the princess . 
513C		
513C*		
514	The Shift of Sex	The Shift of Sex. A king who has only (three) daughters must send a son to war (needs a son for other reasons). The daughters ask to be allowed to pretend to be men, but only the youngest passes tests which her father sets. He gives her magic objects (a horse) and she goes to the war. In some variants a queen has only daughters and, afraid of her husband's anger, pretends that the youngest is a boy. Or for other reasons a woman disguises herself as a man and goes out into the world. The woman in man's clothing  accomplishes heroic deeds and/or goes into service with a king. The daughter (sister) of the king falls in love with her and wants to marry her. The woman in man's clothing refuses, or the marriage is unconsumated. In order to get rid of the “servant/husband”, impossible tasks are set. The woman is able to accomplish these with the help of a helper (several helpers, the horse). Cf. Types 461, 465, 513A–513C. In some variants the tests concern the gender of the “servant,” which had been doubted. For example, her manner of eating and her behavior in a garden are tested, or she is asked to bathe with the brothers of the princess. At the end of the tale, the woman in man's clothing is transformed into a man. This happens either through a demon's curse  or a saint's help, seldom by accident. Then the princess is happy with her husband and the former woman becomes king. Her parents are happy that finally they have a real son.

The king's wife falls in love with the doctor but is repulsed (accuses him of attempting to seduce or rape her ). Angry, she sets an impossible task, which the doctor must perform on pain of death. Often it is to enable a dumb person to speak. The dumb person reveals the intention of the queen, who is executed. The king marries the young woman who had posed as a doctor. Cf. Types 880, 881, 881A, and 884.

Type 854. On the way back, the helper overhears creatures (birds )  prophesy the future. They say that certain dangers that threaten the bridal couple can be averted by particular actions, but also that anyone who reveals this will be turned to stone. The dangers are a horse (other animal) that will run away with (kill) the bridegroom, poisoned food  (drink, clothing ), and a dragon who will kill the bridegroom on his wedding night . When the helper acts to avert the dangers, his actions appear excessive and irrational. When he kills the dragon, drops of its blood fall on the bride's breast. He removes them (with his mouth, or he sucks them out of her body while she is unconscious). The prince construes this as a sexual attack and condemns the helper to death . Before the sentence can be carried out, he justifies himself  and is turned to stone step by step . The prince and his wife mourn the helper. The prince discovers (in a dream) that he can bring his friend back to life by sacrificing his own children. He kills (injures) them and rubs the stone man with their blood .

An angel tells them that he will be healed if he bathes in the blood of Amelius's children. Amelius cuts off their heads to save his friend . The children are restored to life. Or, because his mother had made a vow before his birth, a young man goes on a pilgrimage. He meets a friend through an apple test: a true friend is one who, when he shares an apple, takes the smaller half  (who notices that an apple is missing). When the friend is killed (very ill) and can be cured only by the blood of the children of the young man, he sacrifices his children in order to save his friend . The children are later restored to life. Cf. Types 303, 516.

A lion (wolf) asks the animals if his breath smells bad (his den is dirty). Those who say yes are killed. The monkey gives a flattering answer so that the lion will not kill him. Later the lion pretends to be sick and claims that he needs monkey meat to be cured, so the monkey is killed after all. The fox says he has the sniffles (forgot his glasses) and cannot smell, so he is not killed . Cf. Type 243A. Often the animals are killed, whether they say the lion's breath stinks or not.

When the false wife orders the horse to be killed , the princess persuades a farmhand to hang the horsehead on the wall by a gate where she passes daily. Every day she greets the horsehead with a formula, and it answers regretting the injury that is being done to her . When she speaks a magic formula to make the hat of a goose-boy fly away (to keep an obstrusive goose-boy away from her), he complains to the king. Thereupon the old king starts observing her and finally makes her tell her life story to a stove  (her dog ) (cf. Types 870, 894). The truth comes to light, the real bride marries the prince, and the maidservant is punished (she unwittingly declares her own judgment). Cf. Types 403, 425A.

An unhappy sailor in misery tries to drown himself, but in the water (on shore) he meets a dog (poodle) who offers its help . On the dog's advice he takes it along with him to sea. After three heavy storms (several years) the dog orders the sailor to jump into the water. At the bottom of the sea he finds a castle and a beautiful woman. The dog had warned him of her seductive powers, so he kills her. Inside the castle the dog is waiting for him.

545	The Cat as Helper	The Cat as Helper. This type refers to a cycle of related tales; it combines episodes from types 545A and 545B. 
545A	The Cat Castle	The Cat Castle. A poor girl reaches the king's castle with the help of a cat (dog) , (her sole inheritance ). On the cat's advice she pretends to be the princess of the castle of the cats. The prince falls in love with her (the royal couple receives her). When she looks out of the window and sees her parents quarreling of a pot of porridge, she laughs. Being asked why, she does not want to reveal her humble origin, so she pretends to have been laughing at the poor condition of the king's castle. The girl's noble origin is tested. When she says she possesses a castle more beautiful than that of the king, she is asked to show it. The cat goes to the castle of a troll (giant, giantess)  and kills him (by making him look into the sun). The girl becomes the owner of the castle and marries the king (guests are received: The cat demands to be killed by the girl and turns into a prince . He marries the girl) . Cf. Type 505. 
545A*	The Magic Castle	The Magic Castle. (Including the previous Type 512*.) A poor girl gives all her food to an animal (cat, dog, fox) or to an old beggar (Christ). Afraid that her grandmother (mother, aunt) will punish her, she runs away and comes to a castle. (On the way, supernatural beings transform her adornments from flowers, snail shells, etc. into precious jewels.) She becomes queen. The grandmother comes and demands the food that she had given away. But the grandmother is pushed off the balcony (ladder), dies, and turns into a grapevine (tree), which continues to question the queen about the missing food. The queen laughs at this and her husband demands that she should explain why she laughed. She replies hastily that the toilet brush is more beautiful than his beard (her own castle or garment is more beautiful than his). The animal (supernatural being) helps her to prove this by giving her a bejeweled toilet brush (castle). In some variants a girl is cast out by her older sisters. On the advice of an old man, she goes to work in a castle. When the owner's son asks to see the girl's own castle, the old man helps her to produce one. (Previously Type 512*.) 
545B	Puss in Boots	Puss in Boots. An animal (cat , fox , jackal , monkey , etc.) intends to help a poor man (out of obligation) to become rich (by marrying him to the princess) . In order to gain the emperor's confidence, the animal tells him that the poor man is very wealthy . When the poorly dressed future bridegroom travels to his bride's residence, the animal simulates an accident (robbery), in which all his clothes (horses, bride presents, wedding guests) are lost . Thereupon the king gives the poor man good clothes and he is accepted as a bridegroom. When the man has to display his property, the animal leaves before him and coerces the shepherds and farmers to say that their herds and farmland belong to the poor man. The animal kills the real owner of the properties, a demon (dragon, ogre, giant, witch, magician) by burning, slaying, shooting or through a trick . When the bride arrives with her entourage, the bridegroom presents himself as the real owner of the property. The animal tests the gratitude of the poor man by feigning death (it becomes a human when it is decapitated ). In some variants the man behaves ungrateful or does not keep his promise.

He marries the king's daughter. When the king wants to see the property of his son-in-law, the young man meets an ogre (devil, grateful ghost) who offers to give him his castle, but only if he can solve some riddles. The ogre tells all the farmers and shepherds on the way to pretend to be employees of the poor boy. An old man helps him solve the riddles. The ogre and his brothers burst, and the poor man becomes the owner of the castle and its land. Cf. Type 859.

The two elder princes fall asleep when they watch for the thief, but the youngest is successful. He sees a golden bird  and shoots one of its colored (golden) feathers . (2) A sick king can only be healed by the singing of a golden bird. He orders a search for it . Main part: The three brothers go on a quest for the golden bird. The first two meet a fox (wolf) which they intend to shoot. The fox warns them against going to a pleasant inn in the village, but they go there nevertheless. Both of them forget their father and the bird. The youngest son is kind to the fox, follows its advice, and finds the golden bird . Against the fox's advice he also takes its golden cage and thus wakes the guards. In order to save his life he has to go on a quest for a golden (magic) horse . Again, he also takes its golden bridle, so its guards awake, and he is condemned to death unless he brings a golden maiden (princess) . With the fox's help  he succeeds and finally reaches home with the golden princess, the golden horse, and the golden bird . Against the fox's advice he releases his brothers from the gallows. They steal the bird, the horse, and the princess, and try to kill the youngest brother . They pretend to their father that they have brought him the valuable things . The fox saves the life of the youngest brother (by using water of life). The golden bird, the horse, and the princess identify him as the man who rescued them.

With their help he reaches a magic castle that opens only for one hour. He appeases the animal guards (dragon, etc.) and finds everyone else asleep. He locates the fountain of life (golden apple tree) and takes the remedy . He sleeps with a beautiful woman (princess)  and leaves his name (identification token) with her . When he leaves the castle it closes (sinks). On his way back he rejuvenates (releases) the helpful old men and receives magic objects in return. At home his unsuccessful brothers secretly exchange a common (poisoned) remedy for his healing one . They give it to the king  and he recovers. These brothers slander the youngest and the king orders him to be killed. With the help of his magic objects he is able to escape this sentence. Meanwhile the beautiful woman in the magic castle has given birth to a boy and has discovered the name of the intruder. She arrives at the head of an army and demands the father of her son . The haughty brothers pretend it is they. They accompany her, riding beside the golden cloth (path) which the princess has spread, but they find that the gate at its end is closed. The youngest brother appears in rags, rides down the middle of the golden cloth toward the castle (is recognized by his tokens), and the gate opens for him. He marries the woman  and becomes the ruler of the kingdom. The old king learns what really happened. 
552	The Girls Who Married Animals	The Girls Who Married Animals. (Including the previous Types 552A and 552B.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Following the wish of his dead father and against his brothers' advice, the youngest son marries his three sisters to the first suitors who come for them . The suitors take the girls home with them . On a quest for his sisters, the brother reaches the castles of his brothers-in-law and learns that they are the masters of the three animal kingdoms (men transformed to animals ; cf. Type 302C*). They receive their brother-in-law in a friendly way and provide him with magic means (parts of their body, feathers, hair, etc.)  to use to call them at any time (he leaves a signal of distress). With their help he accomplishes difficult tasks and finally marries a woman (princess). (He is dismembered by an ogre, summons the brothers-in-law, and they resuscitate him; cf. Type 302C*. They also recover his lost castle; cf. Type 560). (Previously Type 552A.) (2) Three girls who despair of being married say that they will marry any one even if the suitors are animals .

Most of the variants present the following basic structure: A man while travelling meets three animals (from air, water and earth) who are in trouble. Because he rescues them, they promise to help him if needed. Later he falls in love with a princess whose father sets three impossible tasks for him to accomplish. With the help of the grateful animals he succeeds on three successive days  and wins the princess. In some variants a part is added in which the man accompanies his elder brothers. When they try to injure some animals, he prevents them from doing so or compensates for their misdeeds and carelessness. When they trample on an ant-hill, he builds it up again, when they leave wounded animals, he takes care of them, etc.

756C*	Receipt from Hell	Receipt from Hell. A tenant goes to hell (with the help of a little man) in order to procure a receipt for the rent from his dead landlord. He brings it back (and receives a mark as sign of contact with the dead). 
756D*	Who Is the More Devout? (previously More Devout)	Who Is the More Devout? (previously More Devout.) A hermit (St. Peter) asks Christ if anyone is more devout than he.

756E*	Charity Rewarded	Charity Rewarded. Charity is rated higher than prayer or attendance at mass . Friends make a pilgrimage to Christ's grave, and another friend stays at home (on the way, in the shop). When he sees a poor man carrying a dead sheep (hen) in order to feed his children, he gives him money (and goods). When the pilgrims return they say that they have also seen their friend who had stayed behind at the grave (their friend's name on the table in church). So they realize that the soul of a person who does good goes to Christ's grave. Cf. Type 759A. 
756G*	Faith Moves Mountains	Faith Moves Mountains . This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A sultan orders that all Christians in his domain be put to death unless they can, by the strength of their belief, move a certain mountain. A poor (one-eyed, blind) shoemaker accomplishes the miracle: the power of his words pushes the mountain into the sea (along with the sultan and his courtiers). Thus the Christians are freed from their imprisonment. (2) A bishop imprisoned by heathens must demonstrate the power of his belief by moving a mountain. While he hesitates, a youth in his service accomplishes the miracle by the strength of his belief. The witnesses are so impressed that they convert to Christianity. (3) A Catholic craftsman uses his hammer to strike a mountain, which is moved into the sea. 
757	The Emperor's Haughtiness Punished (previously The King's Haughtiness Punished)	The Emperor's Haughtiness Punished (previously The King's Haughtiness Punished). (Jovinian, Roderigo). The emperor Jovinian feels like God. When he bathes, a stranger (angel) who looks like him takes away his clothes and reigns in his place . When Jovinian returns naked to the court nobody recognizes him and he is driven away. In his despair he starts to regret his former haughtiness. Later, when he asks again for the sovereignty, he is accepted as emperor. The stranger who had ruled in his place discloses himself as his guardian angel and disappears. From then on the emperor lives humbly in a godfearing manner. 
758	The Various Children of Eve	The Various Children of Eve. After the expulsion from paradise Eve gives birth to a child every year. Her children are all different: some beautiful, some ugly. When God pays her a visit Eve bathes her beautiful children and dresses them nicely. She hides the ugly ones. (She is ashamed of the number of her children and therefore hides some.) When God arrives he blesses the beautiful children and destines them to become kings, earls, citizens or traders. Thereupon Eve wants her ugly children (hidden in the straw, hay, oven) to be blessed as well. God destines those to be farmers, fishermen, smiths, tanners, shoemakers and servants. Upon Eve's protest God explains that every class is necessary and legitimate for the functioning of society. Sometimes Eve consents to God's will . Cf. Type 1416. 
759	Angel and Hermit (previously God's Justice Vindicated)	Angel and Hermit (previously God's Justice Vindicated) . A saint (Moses, Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi, St. Peter, hermit) doubts God's justice and blames him for sending suffering to virtuous people and well-being to bad ones. Or, a saint asks God for the reason for his decisions, an angel asks a saint (hermit) to accompany him to see God's secret decisions, or, an angel and a hermit meet and decide to travel together. The angel (God's messenger) forbids his companion to speak or to ask questions . On their way the angel does many seemingly unjust and cruel things: he kills the child and/or the servant of a hospitable host and a man he meets in the street ; he repays hospitality by stealing a cup , inhospitality by giving a cup (present); he repays an inhospitable person by constructing a house (rebuilding a fallen wall); he destroys the house (harvest) of hospitable people; he damages (sinks) a ship because of one sinner on board ; he kills the only cow of a poor woman; he offers good wishes to inhospitable people, and bad wishes to hospitable ones. Later the angel explains why each of these strange deeds was just. When the hermit sees the justification for each deed, he agrees that none of God's acts should be blamed or doubted. God's deeds are always justified. Cf. Types 759*, 840. 
759*	The Hospitable Widow's Cow Killed	The Hospitable Widow's Cow Killed. A poor widow (man) hospitably receives God and St. Peter for the night . The next day, when God orders a wolf to kill the widow's only cow, St. Peter rebukes God for ingratitude.

759A	The Sinful Priest	The Sinful Priest. A man refuses to receive holy communion from an unworthy priest . God sends him a dream of unbearable thirst. He finds a well where a leper draws water for many people to drink. When he also wants to drink from it, the leper draws back his hand and says, “Why do you want to take water from a leper's hand but you refuse to receive the sacrament from an unworthy priest?” It is reprehensible to say that the power of the sacrament depends on the virtue of the man who gives it . Cf. Type 756E*. 
759B	Holy Man Has his own Mass	Holy Man Has his own Mass. A man never comes to mass. When upbraided for not coming, he hangs his coat on a sunbeam. The priest realizes that he is a pious man and that even though he stays at home, he is nearer to God than the priest himself (other people) . 
759C	The Widow's Flour	The Widow's Flour. A poor woman shares her small property with beggars but loses her last flour (bread) in a storm. When some traders arrive safely in spite of a leak (calm) she complains to the king (Solomon) about the injustice of the wind. In thanks for their rescue, the traders deliver a certain amount (of money) to the king to be given to the poor. At first they do not know where the leak is, but then they discover that a flour sack plugged the hole. The poor woman identifies the sack as the one she had lost, and the king gives her the money as compensation. (The god of the winds has to pay for the compensation) . 
759D	The Punishment of the Angel	The Punishment of the Angel. (Including the previous Type 795.) An angel (the death) is sent by God to take the soul of a widow with two children . He does not fulfill the task . Thereupon God, in order to show that he cares even for the smallest creatures, tells the angel to fetch a stone out of the sea where a small worm is hidden . The angel is punished by becoming deaf, blind or senseless, or he is driven out of the sky. He has to do penance for his sin on earth  by pretending to be human and by serving a man (abbot, hermit, custodian, farmer)  on earth. As a servant he works for his master  but he acts in a ridiculous and strange way, smiling mysteriously . He mocks a man who buys shoes that will last a long time, because the man will die soon. He throws stones at a church (wedding procession) because he sees the devil there. He favours a pub because the people inside pray and ask for God's mercy. At the burial of a dignitary he behaves disrespectfully, while at the burial of a poor man he renders his reverence . He mocks holy things and scorns a crucifix (holy statue, shrine). He contradicts a judgment, saying it is wrong. He insults a beggar for being in reality a rich man. When he meets an emperor and his brother, a bishop, he smiles because he recognizes them as the two pitiful children who were the reason why he had been punished, and who had both achieved high positions. By this the angel finally learns something about divine justice. 
759E	The Miller of Sans Souci	The Miller of Sans Souci. A ruler's new palace is built where there is already a building (house, mill) that belongs to one of his subjects (old woman, miller).

But the corpse holds her fast and asks her to beg his murdered fiancées' pardon when they come to the church. They agree only after the third time, whereupon the corpse returns to the grave and finds rest. In some variants a boy who mocks the church (clergyman, Virgin Mary) is condemned and sinks to earth as a stone. Later the stone is found and carried into a room where it laughs and tells its story. A special word cancels the curse and the corpse in the form of the stone changes to dust. 
760**	The Obstinate Child	The Obstinate Child. An obstinate child (son) is disobedient and hits (mistreats) his mother. He becomes ill and dies. After he is buried, his hand keeps reaching out of the grave and will not decompose . The authorities advise his mother to strike the hand with a stick until it is bloody. It then goes back into the grave and the child is able to rest in peace. 
760***	Salvation in the Cradle	Salvation in the Cradle. The soul of a dead man is unable to rest (is tormented in purgatory).

The dead man is willing to be taken back to his grave only by the person (brave girl) who had taken him out of it. (The skeleton clings to the girl until they reach home, where it explains that it could not find peace because in its lifetime it had slandered an illegitimate child.

In some variants Christ travels with some of his followers. When they find a treasure he tells them not to touch it but to continue their way. Later two of them return secretly to take the treasure and they murder one another. Or, two men find the treasure and murder one another.

When the priest arrives, the prince instead invites him to dinner. The courtiers ask the prince why he suddenly changed his mind. He says that someone standing next to him told him what to do. No one else saw such a person, so the prince thinks it must have been an angel. (2) A girl going through a forest is followed by a man who tries to rape her.

Type 1718*. Version from the Middle Ages: A farmer leading a cow and a calf to St. Michael fears the sea and calls on the saint for help, promising to sacrifice the calf. When free from danger, he says that St. Michael was foolish to expect him to give the calf. Again the sea rises, again the farmer calls for help, and St. Michael appears.

In order to keep the work secret, the hammer is silent or the axe never gets dull on the stone chopping block . The devil finds out the secret of the construction of the ark from Noah's wife. He persuades her to give Noah an intoxicating drink , so Noah tells his secret and the devil destroys the ark . Noah weeps and an angel instructs him how to rebuild it. By performing a washing ritual (water circle) Noah is able to keep the devil away from the ark. A gong calls the animals to board the ark. Some creatures are barred but finally they all enter: the serpent , the insects, the fly , fabulous creatures like the unicorn , the phoenix  and the giant . By a ruse the devil manages to enter the ark: he hides near Noah's wife (at her breast, in her work-basket, in her shadow). She does not enter the ark until Noah calls her with a curse addressed to the devil . On board, the devil, in the form of a mouse, gnaws a hole in the ark and tries to sink it , but a cat swallows the mouse. Helpful animals (serpent, hare, fish, dog) offer to close the hole with part of their body (tail, nose); smaller animals (tortoise, salamander, rabbit) are used as a plug. The serpent demands fresh (human) blood every day for its help. After the deluge, Noah throws the serpent into a holy fire.

His harvest is very poor and he repents his behavior too late. (3) The discourteous sower. A passer-by (God) asks a farmer what he is sowing. Rudely he answers that he is sowing stones. The passer-by wishes him a good harvest, which turns out to be stone plants. (A farmer tells Christ that he is sowing pumpkins [turnips], though his seed is maize. Thereupon he harvests only pumpkins.) . (4) Weather forecast. Christ asks farmers if there will be rain. Two answer that frogs (foxes, other animals) predict rain.

But at home he cannot take the skin off  (until the stolen treasure has been returned). (2) The rich man (miller, butcher, baker) fails to take the treasure because the devil himself in disguise as a traveler (black horseman, soldier, hunter) stays at the poor man's house as an overnight guest (meets him on his way) and kills (abducts) the rich man.

Whenever the beggar receives the bread he states, “Everything you do, you do it to yourself!” The rich man becomes tired of this (angry about the beggar's words, wants to get rid of the beggar) so he (and his wife) puts poison into the beggar's bread. Further on his way the beggar meets a hungry young man (traveler) to whom he gives his bread. The young man dies and it turns out that he is the son of the rich man. So the beggar's statement was true .

Type 923B), the other of whom asks the king (emperor, sultan, master), receive two loaves (flat cake, cakes, roasted chicken) from the king. In one of the loaves nothing (bones) is hidden, the other one is filled with (pieces of) gold. By this gift the king intended to reward the beggar who had asked for his help, and to demonstrate his secular power. But the beggars exchange their loaves, because the one who trusted in secular power thought that his loaf was not well baked because it was so heavy. When the king learns about the exchange he agrees that God's power is stronger than his own . Cf. Types 745A, 842, and 947.

His adversary (slanderer) intends to throw him into the blast furnace of the ironworks (limekiln, mine, well, brewery, baking oven) or to kill him by some other means. He is sent to the place where he is to be killed. Those who are charged with his murder are told to kill the first man who arrives (he brings along a message, a letter commanding his murder  or certain object such as a handkerchief or lemon). According to his father's advice, the young man goes to mass on the way and is delayed. His slanderer (adversary), impatient to see him dead, arrives the place before him and is killed instead of him. The innocent young man then reports his slanderer's death. He is restored to favor, or gains fortune, wealth and honour . Cf. Type 930. 
910L	Do Not Drive the Insects Away	Do Not Drive the Insects Away. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A fox crossing a river falls into a crevice and cannot get out. He becomes infested with lice (flies). A hedgehog passing by sees the fox suffering and offers to help. The fox refuses, saying that these lice are already full, and if the hedgehog takes them away, new lice who are even hungrier will come . (2) A sick (injured) man covered with sores is bothered by flies. He refuses any help, saying that hungry flies bite twice as hard as full ones. (3) A merchant is captured by robbers (farmers want to punish a corrupt mayor or a thievish miller, a landlord wants to punish one of his tenants). They undress him (and cover him with honey) and tie him to a tree where there are many flies. A man (knight) offers to drive the insects away, but the merchant refuses, saying that others even worse and more hungry will come in their place. (The farmers set the mayor [miller] free and decide to let him stay in his office, lest someone even greedier would take his place.) 
910M	Prayers for the Tyrant	Prayers for the Tyrant. An old woman prays every day for the health of a hated tyrant. Asked why she does this, she explains that she has twice seen a horrible tyrant die, only to be replaced with one even worse. Therefore she hopes that the present one will live for a long time . 
910N	The Magic Box	The Magic Box. A poor farmer (farmwife) complains to his neighbor (clergyman) that his farm is not doing well. The neighbor gives him a box which he says is magic, and tells the farmer to carry it once each day through his house and barn. When the farmer does this, he notices what the problems are and becomes wealthy. In another version, an older woman tells an incompetent housewife that she should look all over her house and yard for a white sparrow. As she does this, the housewife puts everything in order and becomes prosperous. 
911*		
912	The Wise Man and the Rain of Fools	The Wise Man and the Rain of Fools. During a certain rainy period, everyone on whom the water falls becomes a fool (is compelled to sing and dance). A wise man arrives and sees that all the adults and children have gone crazy. He joins them in their foolery. He asks why they behave thus, and they reply him that it is because of the rain. The wise man tastes some of the rainwater and he also becomes a fool . In Arabic variants a ruler hears that everyone who came into contact with the rainwater became crazy, so he does not drink it. But when he sees that he no longer holds his former power and authority, he drinks the water. 
915	All Depends on How You Take It	All Depends on How You Take It. A widower with a clever, industrious daughter marries a widow with a stupid, lazy daughter. When the children are grown and ready to leave home, their mother (father) gives them three indirectly expressed precepts to guide them in their new independence (employment, marriage). On a visit the mother (parents) realizes that her own daughter has followed the precepts literally and therefore caused herself much trouble. Her stepdaughter, however, recognized the underlying meaning of the precepts (often with the help of her father) and therefore everything goes well for her . Cf. Type 915A. 
915A	The Misunderstood Precepts	The Misunderstood Precepts. A dying father (mother) gives indirectly expressed advice to his son (daughter) (before marriage): “Always eat bread with honey” (means: “Work diligently and your bread will be as sweet as honey”) , “God bless you in your labors” (means: “Start your work earlier than others, so that others will greet you thus and not you them”)  and “Always wear your shoes” (means: “Walk the fields barefooted, wear your shoes only when near the town”) . When the son follows these precepts literally, he becomes poor. Only later does he learn their real meaning. Or, the father gives ironic precepts: “Whenever you feel like gambling, do it until your eyes are red and your cheeks are pale,” “Whenever you feel like drinking, do it until you are drunk and fall asleep,” and “Whenever you desire a woman, go there early in the morning and wake her up”. Following the precepts he gambles away all his money. Drinking to forget his losses, he feels so ill the next morning that he wants never to drink again. He visits a woman early in the morning and is so scared by her appearence that he runs home. There he thinks about his father's “bad” precepts that cured him of gambling, drinking and womanizing. (Other precepts see H588ff.) 
916	The Brothers Guarding the King's Bedchamber and the Snake	The Brothers Guarding the King's Bedchamber and the Snake. Several brothers are hired by a king to guard his bedchamber. The first brother sees a snake in the bedchamber and kills it, but a drop of its poison falls on the queen. While he is wiping the poison, she awakes and accuses him trying to attack her  (cf. Type 516). The other brothers tell stories against making a hasty decision. The next morning the truth comes to light. The stories: (1) The innocent dog (cf. Type 178A). (2) The faithful dog as security for a debt (cf. Type 178B). (3) The falcon and the poisoned water (cf. Type 178C). (4) The parrot and the fruit of youth. A parrot brings to a king, his master, some fruit of youth. Unbeknown to the parrot a snake has dropped poison on the fruit. The king gives one of the fruits to a dog which dies, and then slays the parrot . Later the truth comes to light. 
91A*		
92	The Lion Dives for his own Reflection	The Lion Dives for his own Reflection. (Including the previous Type 92A.) A fox (hare) has to supply a lion every day with his dinner. One day he pretends to have met a stronger lion (who took the dinner). The first lion wants to fight against the second. The fox takes him to a well and shows him his reflection. The lion takes it for his rival, jumps in (is pushed in), and drowns . In some variants a hare drives an elephant (several elephants) out of the realm of the hares by showing it a reflection of the moon in water, seemingly quivering with anger . (Previously Type 92A.) Cf. Types 34, 34A, 1168A, and 1336. 
920	The Son of the King and the Son of the Smith	The Son of the King and the Son of the Smith. Because her young (unborn) son calls his mother a whore , the queen commands that the child (the young Solomon) be killed . The child asks the servant for mercy; he is not killed  but raised by a smith. In order that her husband should not discover this deceit, the queen takes the smith's son as her own . During their childhood, the two boys play along with others. In their game, Solomon stands out because, playing the part of the king , he convicts one of the boys as a traitor. Or, the smith's son speaks of farming matters, but Solomon speaks of military affairs. His father the king (in person or through a messenger) tests the boy's wisdom with impossible tasks or difficult questions . Or, the boy (often acting as a shepherd ) makes wise judgments or observations that reveal his royal origin . His intelligent answers show him to be the son of the king. Cf. esp. Types 875, 921, and 922. In some variants an additional episode may follow, but more often this is a separate tale: Solomon's wife elopes with a rival king. Solomon goes to retrieve her. He is captured but is permitted to blow his horn three times before his death . This was a prearranged signal, and his army comes and rescues him. 
920A	The Case of the Boiled Eggs (previously The Daughter of the King and the Son of the Peasant)	The Case of the Boiled Eggs (previously The Daughter of the King and the Son of the Peasant). A princess as baby is secretly exchanged by her mother with the son of a farmwife , because the king has threatened to kill her if she does not give birth to a boy. Later the king has to judge a case: A merchant who bought forty eggs before a journey, intends to pay for them after his return. But he is asked to pay for the value of all the chickens and their offspring that would have hatched from the eggs . The king does not know how to judge the case, and by chance overhears the exchanged children playing a game, the case of the boiled eggs  (cf. Type 821B). The princess plays the role of the king and points out that chickens could never hatch from boiled eggs. The king adopts the girl's decision . Finally the children's identity is discovered and they are reexchanged. Cf. Types 821B, 875, and 875E. 
920A*	The Inquisitive King	The Inquisitive King. Solomon states that all women could be seduced (are more stupid than men), even his mother. He proves his statement by sending a servant to seduce her. In order to test her chastity Solomon disguises himself and goes in place of the servant to the meeting point . When his mother is about to commit incest with her own son, she realizes the deception and curses him: He cannot die until he has measured the height of the sky and the depth of the sea (before having gone around the earth and to the bottom of the sea). Thereupon Solomon vainly attempts to measure the height of the sky and the depth of the sea . On the back of a bird he flies to the sun, but the bird's wings are burned and he falls down (eagles take him up to the sky and let him fall down, the curse becomes true.) He sits inside a box fixed to a chain, and tells a woman to lower it down to the bottom of the sea. Unfortunately a crayfish cuts the chain. In some variants his measuring is successful. On an old woman's back he rides to the stars, and devils save him from the submerged box. Cf. Types 823A*, 922.
920B	The Birds Chosen by the Sons of the King (previously What Kind of Bird)	The Birds Chosen by the Sons of the King (previously What Kind of Bird). A king asks his three sons what kind of bird they would prefer to be. The first chooses an eagle, because it is ruler of birds. The second chooses a falcon, because it is beloved of the nobles. The third says that he would like to be a bird that flies with many others, so as to receive advice. The king chooses the third son as the next king, because as a ruler he would always seek advice . 
920B*	The Lineage of the King's Three Sons	The Lineage of the King's Three Sons. A captive king interrogates the three sons of the king who has captured him as to how they will treat him (he gives them riddles). From their answers he learns their real descent. One of the sons is from a family of executioners (bakers), the other one from butchers, while only the third son is from the royal family. 
920C	Shooting at the Father's Corpse as a Test of Paternity	Shooting at the Father's Corpse as a Test of Paternity. In order to determine the true heir (his own son) among his three sons, a dying king (rich man) requires that each should shoot at his corpse. The youngest refuses to shoot (at his heart)  and is therefore judged the only genuine son of his dead father; the two others are determined to be illegitimate and are disinherited . 
920C*	The Choice of a Wife	The Choice of a Wife. A young man asks Solomon (another king) for advice about what sort of girl he should marry: one with property, one with money, or a poor one with nothing. Solomon answers, “Go away; you don't know anything; do whatever you like.” (“Be quiet, I am in charge; get up, so I can sit down; do whatever you like.”). The answers mean accordingly, that the first girl would chase him away because the property belongs to her; the second would tell him that the money is hers and he is ignorant; but the third one will not meddle with anything, even if she is bad tempered. 
920D	The Four Princes	The Four Princes. Of the king's four sons, the one who can name the greatest number of faults of their father, is to become the next king. The youngest son cannot name a single fault . He becomes king. 
920E	The Three Rings	The Three Rings. A dying father gives each of his three (more) sons (children) a ring (stone). Only one of the rings is genuine, and each son thinks it is his. The questions of which is the genuine ring and which is the true son are decided on religious (Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or sectarian) grounds . 
921	The King and the Farmer's Son	The King and the Farmer's Son. A boy (farmer's son, Solomon) astonishes a king passing by his hut by giving clever answers. The answers refer to questions like: what do you (does your father, mother, brother, sister) do? . And/or they deal with a paradoxical demand to come to the king under certain conditions . The following questions and answers are most frequent: (1) What are you doing? I boil those coming and going (I boil peas, beans, and/or lentils that keep rising and falling in the water ). (2) What is your father doing? He makes a bad thing worse (he blocks a path in a field which causes another to be trodden ). Or, he is in the vineyard doing good and bad (he prunes vines but sometimes cuts good ones and leaves the bad ). Or, he makes many out of few (he sows grain ). (3) What is your mother doing? She does for another what the latter cannot do for herself (she lays out a corpse ). Or, she is baking forgotten bread (to pay back borrowed bread ). (4) What is your brother doing? He hunts; he throws away what he catches, and what he does not catch he carries home (he hunts for lice on his body ). (5) What is your sister doing? She is mourning last year's laughter (she nurses her child, the fruit of last year's love affair . Cf. Types 875, 920. 
921A	The Sharing of Bread or Money (previously Four Coins)	The Sharing of Bread or Money (previously Four Coins). A farmer (craftsman) responds to the king's question, why he is working so hard or how he would use his salary (four coins, bread), by giving enigmatic answers: The first I eat (feed myself), the second I put out at interest (give to my children so that they can care for me when I am old), with the third I pay debts (keep my parents) and the fourth I throw away (give to my wife) . The king asks his ministers to interpret the farmer's answers for him. When they ask the farmer, he demands a reward for each response. In a medieval version, a smith named Focus, who worked on a feast day despite the emperor's prohibition, is betrayed by a statue constructed by the magician Virgil. He defends himself by stating that he needs to earn eight coins daily. Two of the coins he has to repay (to his father), two he has to lend (to his son), two are lost (to be given to his wife) and two are to be spent (for himself). 
921A*	The Frank Thief	The Frank Thief. A king asks prisoners why they have been imprisoned. All say they are innocent except one, who confesses he is a thief (counterfeiter, etc.). He is released so that he will not spoil the others. 
921B	Best Friend, Worst Enemy	Best Friend, Worst Enemy. The central motif of the tale is the following task: A man should bring his best friend and his worst enemy . He fulfills the task by choosing his dog as friend and his wife as enemy. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) When the master orders his servant (Aesop) to bring food to the person who loves him most, The servant serves his dog instead of his wife. The wife feels offended and threatens to leave her husband. The servant explains that only the dog would really love his master for it would return even if it had been beaten. (2) A young man violates the order that all old people should be killed. He hides his father with the help of his wife. Because of the intrigues of some envious men, the king demands that the young man, on pain of death, bring his servant, his friend (jester) and his enemy to the king. Following his father's advice he takes his donkey as servant, his dog as friend (his child as jester) and his wife as enemy. The offended wife reproaches her husband for classifying her in this way after she had helped him hide his father. This betrayal turns her into his enemy and so he accomplishes the task. Cf. Type 981. (3) A young man rescues the devil (stranger, saint, ghost, robber) from a wolf (other danger) whereupon the devil promises pay for the service if the young man will bring his most faithful friend to the meeting. The man comes with his wife. The devil appears in a rich disguise and persuades the wife to kill her husband when he is asleep. Later he promises her marriage and wealth. The woman agrees. When she raises the knife (ax, stone) for the murder, the devil awakens her husband. He says that he has now repaid the man by saving his life, and refuses to pay the recompense. The man should have brought his dog instead of his wife. (The man must bring his real friend the next day. His dog follows him without being called, attacks the stranger, and proves its faithfulness.) Cf. Type 824. 
921B*	Thief, Beggar, Murderer	Thief, Beggar, Murderer. A nobleman (emperor, clergyman) observes an old farmer laboriously plowing his field. Asked if he has no sons who can help him, the old man answers that he has three university-trained sons, one is a thief (robber, liar, oppressor), another a murderer (oppressor, Gypsy), and the third a beggar (deceiver, rascal). The nobleman begins to understand when the farmer explains in detail that his first son is a judge, the second a doctor (butcher) and the third a clergyman (monk, teacher). 
921C	Why Hair of Head is Gray before the Beard	Why Hair of Head is Gray before the Beard. A man (clergyman, barber) answers the question why the hair of his head is grey (white) and the hair of his beard is black, “The hair of the head is twenty years older than the beard.” . 
921C*	Astronomer and Doctor at Farmer's House	Astronomer and Doctor at Farmer's House. A farmer predicts the weather according to his animals' behavior (cf. Type 830B) (when the flies take shelter under the horse's tail, rain will come) better then the astronomer (philosopher), who is his guest. Moreover the farmer knows more then the doctor, who is also his guest, about the choice of wholesome food and the spread of disease . 
921D	The Fatal Bed	The Fatal Bed. A citizen asks a sailor why he repeatedly goes to sea even though his father and grandfather drowned there. The sailor asks how the citizen's ancestors died. The townsman answers, “In bed”, whereupon the sailor asks if the citizen isn't afraid of going to bed? .
921D*	Witty Answers	Witty Answers. (Including the previous Type 1702C*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a man who makes another man angry by giving absurd answers . A master (nobleman, lawyer) asks a farmer (foreman) returning from the market, if the market was large. The farmer answers, “I did not measure it!” The master says, “No, I wanted to know if it was crowded?” The farmer says, “I did not count the people!” Thereupon the master becomes angry and plans to invite the farmer for dinner and then to set his dogs on him. On the way to dinner the farmer finds two hares. When the master lets his dogs loose the farmer releases his hares so that the dogs chase them . The master orders his servant to serve the farmer wine in the cellar and then to beat him. When the farmer takes away the plug from the cask, the servant has to hold the hole closed and the farmer beats him. Cf. Type 1539A*. Later the farmer hides a piece of bacon under his shirt and bends over as he climbs the stairs. When people ask him if he has enough, he answers, “Now I have enough for my children and for myself to lick for six weeks!” When the farmer is brought to court for beating the servant, he pretends to be an idiot and therefore cannot be tried. 
921E	Never Heard Before	Never Heard Before. A man is required to say something that neither the king nor his courtiers has ever heard before . The man reads a letter supposedly from another king demanding repayment of money that this king had borrowed. 
921E*	The Potter	The Potter. A potter amazes the king with his clever answers. The king orders his nobles to buy pots from the potter. The potter raises the price. One noble does not want to pay and agrees, instead of payment, to carry the potter into the palace on his shoulders. Or, the king sets a riddle to his nobles: What is the worst evil in the world? They do not know an answer. Only the potter knows it. He demonstrates the solution by placing himself onto his cart with pots and tells a nobleman (who asked him for the solution) to pull it to the palace. The king appoints the potter nobleman. 
921F	Philosopher Spits in the King's Beard	Philosopher Spits in the King's Beard. A philosopher is invited to dine with the king. During the meal he is obliged to spit and does so in the king's beard. The servants become indignant and want to beat him, but the king insists on asking the philosopher  why he did such a thing. The philosopher answers that everything else around him was silk or gold, so the king's beard was the most suitable place for spitting. The king accepts this explanation . 
921F*	Plucking Geese (previously Geese from Rus)	Plucking Geese (previously Geese from Rus). A farmer (craftsman) impresses a ruler by his clever questions and answers, which his courtiers were not able to give. The ruler promises to send the farmer geese (other birds, animals) for him to pluck (cut, milk, skin). The “geese” are courtiers who, under threat of dismissal (death), have to solve riddles that the farmer poses. (The ruler says, “The geese from Russia are flying here [the nobles]; pluck them!”) Making use of the ruler's advice, the farmer takes much money from them (for explaining the answer to the riddle). 
922	The Shepherd Substituting for the Clergyman Answers the King's Questions	The Shepherd Substituting for the Clergyman Answers the King's Questions. (The King and the Abbot) . A person of high social status (emperor, king, civil servant, teacher) demands that a clergyman (bishop, abbot, priest, petitioner) answers three difficult questions within a certain period of time on pain of death . The clergyman cannot answer the questions and therefore sends a (disguised) representative  (servant, shepherd, miller, brother). This man answers all the questions correctly for him. When the deception comes to light, the questioner forgives the ruse and rewards the person who answered  (often spares the life of the superior or the brother). Many of the questions require measuring (counting) something that cannot be measured (counted). By means of wordplay (How much does the moon weigh? A pound, since it has four quarters ), by setting an impossible condition at the end of a non-provable statement (How many leaves are on the tree? So and so many, and if you do not believe, count them , or as many as there are stems ), or of a non-provable comparison (How many stars are in heaven? As many as grains of sand are on the beach, and if you are able to count them, you know how many stars are in heaven ), etc. , the person answering turns the questioning ad absurdum. The questions include, “How many drops of water are in the sea?” ; “How high is heaven?” ; “How many hairs are on my head?” ; “How many seconds are there in eternity?” ; “How far is one end of the world from the other?” ; “Where is the center of the earth?” ; “How much is the king worth?” ; “What is the sweetest song?” ; “Which is the best fowl?”; “What is the swiftest, the sweetest and the most costly?” ; “How much is a golden plow worth?” ; “What does God do?” ; “How far is it from fortune to misfortune?” ; “What am I thinking?” . Cf. Types 875, 920A. 
922A	Ahiqar	Ahiqar . A childless minister adopts his nephew (Ahiqar), rears and teaches him. He presents his foster-son to the king, who likes the boy's clever answers. When the minister becomes old, he recommends the king his foster-son as his successor. The young boy is appointed to the office, but slanders his foster-father. The king orders that the old minister to be killed. Instead, he is saved, and a slave is killed in his place. When a hostile king learns about the minister's death, he sets the king tasks that cannot be accomplished by anyone. He asks for a person who is able to build a castle in the air and who can answer difficult questions. The king searches desperately for his old minister. When he learns that he is still alive, he just reinstates him in his former position. Under a different name the old minister travels to the hostile king. He lets a child sitting in a basket be carried into the air by an eagle, where the boy exclaims, “Give me stones and lime so that I can start building the palace!” After solving all the riddles set by the king, he returns with a rich reward. He asks his foster-son to be summoned and punishes him with a cruel death. 
922B	The King's Face on the Coin	The King's Face on the Coin. A king meets a farmer (smith) and receives enigmatic answers to his questions. When the farmer later explains the sense of his answers the king forbids him to reveal the solutions unless he has seen him (his face) 100 times. Then he gives a (several) coin to the farmer. When the king reports his strange conversation with the farmer to his advisers, none of them knows an answer. They locate the questioner who, as instructed, refuses to tell them anything. But he gives in when his demand the payment with a certain number of coins with the king's picture on it is fulfilled. When the king hears the solution from his advisers, he suspects that the farmer has told the secret and reproaches (punishes) him. But the farmer is innocent because he had seen the picture of the ruler 100 times on the coins. He is rewarded by the king (appoints him adviser, marries him to his daughter) . 
923	Love Like Salt	Love Like Salt. A king (rich man) asks his three daughters, how much they love him. The two elder ones compare their love with precious (sweet) things (gold, precious stones, sugar, honey, precious clothes), but the youngest says that she loves him like salt . The father is offended by his youngest daughter's answer and casts her out (orders her death), whereas he rewards the elder daughters in proportion to the value of their flatteries . The youngest daughter then works as a maidservant in a foreign country, whose king she later marries. She invites her father to the wedding meal and serves him dishes without any salt. Thus the father becomes aware of the indispensability of salt. The daughter discloses her identity. Cf. Type 510B. 
923A	Like Wind in the Hot Sun	Like Wind in the Hot Sun. A wife says that she loves her husband like wind in the hot sun. First he is offended but later in the hot sun he learns the value of the wind on a hot day. He understands the meaning of his wife's words (and returns to her) . 
923B	The Princess Who Was Responsible for her Own Fortune	The Princess Who Was Responsible for her Own Fortune. When a king asks his (three) daughters who is responsible for their good fortune (who has the blessing of the kingdom, wealth and honour), the elder daughters answer that he is the one, but the youngest says that she herself (only God ) is responsible (she states that a woman is responsible for her husband's fortune). Her father becomes angry at her statement and forces her to marry a beggar (cripple) with whom she must live in humble circumstances (she is driven forth). Some variants begin with a description of a prince who became a cripple: A prince observes the struggle of two snakes and helps the weaker one, asking that it not harm him. Nevertheless the snake creeps through his mouth into his body, deforms him, and makes him sick. The prince is cast off by his father and becomes a beggar . Through his wife's wit (skill) the beggar becomes rich, becomes a king, or is cured of his disease . In other variants the husband magically returns to his former identity as prince . The father visits the new king, recognizes his daughter and is forced to admit that she is responsible for her own fortune. Or her father has, in the meantime, lost his kingdom , and wanders impoverished to the palace of his daughter. 
924	Discussion in Sign Language	Discussion in Sign Language. (Including the previous Types 924A and 924B.) . Two men (king and shepherd, priest and Jew , Roman and Greek, soldier and artist) have a conversation (dispute) in sign language. Interpreting signs falsely they misunderstand each other; e.g.: The king holds up one finger meaning, “I alone am powerful.” The shepherd thinks the king is asking for one sheep and holds up two fingers, meaning he will give two sheep to the king. The king interprets the two fingers as meaning, “God is as powerful as you.” (Previously Type 924B.) 
924A		
924B		
925	Tidings for the King (previously Tidings Brought to the King, “You Said it, not I”)	Tidings for the King (previously Tidings Brought to the King, “You Said it, not I”). The king states that anyone who tells him his horse is dead must die. A servant tells the king about flies creeping into the mouth of his horse and creeping out where the tail is. When the king exclaims that his horse must be dead then, the servant tells him, “You said it, not I.” . (Cf. Type 2040.) 
925*	The Most Beautiful in the Garden	The Most Beautiful in the Garden. A poor woman sends her three sons out into the world.

The youngest replies, “Yourself”. Thereupon the princess marries him . 
926	Judgment of Solomon	Judgment of Solomon. Two women both claim a child. The judge Solomon offers to cut it in half. One of the women refuses (lets go when the child is to be torn asunder, tries to stop the judge from cutting it) and is therefore determined to be the real mother . 
926A	The Clever Judge and the Demon in the Pot	The Clever Judge and the Demon in the Pot. In order to possess a beautiful woman, a demon (magician) takes on the appearance of her husband and claims her as his wife. The husband and the demon argue about which is the real husband. Numerous persons are asked for advice, but nobody can distinguish between the two men. Finally a judge (clever boy [who plays at being a king or a judge], shepherd, hare, jackal, parrot) states that whichever can creep into a pot (tube) is the real husband. The husband is not able to enter, but the demon creeps inside immediately. The pot is covered, and the demon is recognized and trapped. The real husband gets his wife back . Cf. Types 155, 331. 
926A*	“Purchase Not him who Surpasses you”	“Purchase Not him who Surpasses you.” (Including the previous Type 654B*.) A father (widow) sends his son (three sons) away to learn a craft (earn money). But the boy learns to play an instrument and cards instead. When he is to be sold as slave to a merchant (when he seeks employment with a rich man) he says, “Do not buy someone who is superior to you,” or “Whoever takes me will regret it; whoever does not take me will regret it twice as much.” By his clever actions, by playing off persons against each other, by his music, and by gambling he succeeds in different situations. At the end he marries the daughter of the rich man (dealer, captain). When his father-in-law violates a king's decree (ships are no longer allowed to shoot cannons) and is condemned to death, the youth frees him from the gallows (with three empty nutshells, which signify his father-in-law's worth). At the end, the young man attains wealth and honour.

987	False Magician Exposed by Clever Girl	False Magician Exposed by Clever Girl. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A magician deceives the eyes of spectators making them believe that a rooster can pull (carry) a heavy beam (a rope-dancer can push a cart, juggle a beam). A girl with a four-leafed shamrock (snake, dead toad, salamander) understands the trick and states that the rooster can only pull straw . The magician takes revenge by making the girl believe she is going through deep water. She raises her dress as high as possible and all spectators mock her. (A lock magically closes the girl's mouth so that she cannot speak). (2) A juggler pretends to be able to creep through a thick beam (stone). The girl with the shamrock discovers that he only creeps over it or next to it. The water-episode follows, and in some variants the girl is bewitched into being lame or crooked. 
990	The Seemingly Dead Revives	The Seemingly Dead Revives. A woman becomes ill during an epidemic and falls into a deathlike faint. Her husband orders her buried and puts a precious ring (clothes) into her coffin. One of the grave-diggers returns to the cemetery at night, reopens the grave, and tries to rob the dead. Thereupon (when he tries to cut her finger) the woman revives, leaves the grave, and returns home to her husband. He receives her kindly and they continue to live together for a long time in good health . 
992	The Eaten Heart	The Eaten Heart. A knight woos a married woman. The husband kills his wife's lover (suitor) and orders the cook to prepare his heart and to serve it to his wife. When she praises the meal, he tells her what she has eaten, remarking that her lover pleases her dead as well as alive. Thereupon she jumps out the window (refuses any food, dies from pain). The husband regrets his deed (is punished by the ruler, by the woman's relatives) . 
992A	The Adulteress's Penance	The Adulteress's Penance. A merchant admires a sovereign who invites him to his castle. At dinner the merchant observes that the sovereign's wife is served her meal in a skull (her lover's head with beard). In his bedroom he finds two dead young men hanging. The sovereign explains to him that his wife had committed adultery with a duke whereupon he had him beheaded. In return, the son of the duke killed the two young men. As penance, the woman has to eat from the skull, and the two corpses are a reminder of the murder.
