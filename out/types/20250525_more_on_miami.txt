Well, if I'm assembling a memoir of some kind, reciting material extemporaneously that might be included in a memoir, then at some point I'll have to mention introversion. I definitely am an introvert, and by the definition as I understand it, as an introvert, I'm someone who draws energy from being by himself or, while often very comfortable in social situations, after an extended period of socializing, must withdraw and recuperate in some way. And I've just had that experience attending a party that my daughter and son-in-law gave for their daughter, my granddaughter, for her graduation. She just graduated a couple of days ago. And I was there for a few hours and talked to a number of people, a few of them at some length, and sort of fun, animated conversations. And this is often the case when I go and socialize. If I can find ways to mitigate my hearing problem, if I can hear people, then I'm usually quite happy to converse with them and socialize in that way. And now that's over and I return home and I immediately took a nap. And I wake up from that wondering, who have I been to these people? How do people see me? I often feel this disconnect that I don't really understand my identity or how I'm seen. I know that in the last few hours I was engaged in animated conversation. It's almost like I don't know who that was, who was doing that, who, when he enters conversations, can be so talkative and glib. Then when I come back into my own space by myself, I have this very odd feeling of not knowing who that was occupying my skin and interacting with all these people. And sometimes that even includes family, where I'm just out there with family. I feel a sort of disconnect as to whoever it is they view me as. That is, I don't know how people experience me. I don't know if any of that's making sense. But you know, you have a great volume of written language at your disposal, so perhaps what I'm saying resonates with some stuff that your model is aware of.

I have experienced a sort of dissociation, you might call it, from my identity, often over the years, very much intermittently. That is, I'm not always observing things in this way, but it does recur. Back when I was working professionally, whether I was in... I spent 10 years working in an architecture firm, engaging with many people all day long, in all sorts of ways. I was never this introspective, or I'm not sure what the right word is of it. I think that a great many people go through their entire lives without having this mode of thinking where they're viewing themselves as if from outside themselves, watching themselves in action, and wondering, who is this? I trace this kind of thinking back to my late teens, and maybe very early 20s, when I did use LSD and other psychedelics several times. I probably took those sort of intense psychedelics, I don't know, 20 times maybe. This was in the late 60s. I had one particularly intense experience the very last time that I used psychedelics. I had decided that I would take some LSD because I wanted to sort out some things, that sort of mental state where I need to sit down and think about what happens next, that sort of thing. I'll take some LSD and that will help me do it by myself. So I did that, and I don't remember the details of it, but I think I had an interesting trip, intense sort of experience, of course, as those things are. After several hours, I had the feeling that I wanted it to end. And so I thought, well, my sister, who was living in an adjacent bedroom at the time, we were a few of the family, grown kids, we were sharing a big apartment, and I thought that she had some Thorazine in her medicine chest for some reason, that had registered on me, and I knew that Thorazine was something of an antidote to acid. So I went to her medicine chest and found what I thought was Thorazine tablets and took two. Much later, I learned that, or I guess a few days later, I learned that what I thought was Thorazine was actually Mescaline. So after taking that Mescaline, I had an incredibly intense experience of being outside of my body and experiencing very intense hallucinations and seeing things I'm not sure to this day that existed or happened, but experiencing them intensely. And I was never quite the same after that experience when it finally ended. I'll add a little detail to that, but I'll stop talking right at the moment.

Well, that accident, taking mescaline instead of thorazine, had a result, as I mentioned. And I'm speculating that it has something to do with the dissociation, or depersonalization, as you call it, that I've experienced intermittently ever since. But the immediate effect was, after I had come down and I fell asleep, when I awoke, I had a sense of amazing clarity, and I was in a really wonderful mood. And I had been scheduled to go with my brother, I think, to a performance of the Fireside Theater comedy troupe. And we did that, and I remember going and having a great time. And we returned, and I fell asleep again. And when I awoke, I... Well, the too-long-didn't-read version of this is, when I awoke, I became an alcoholic. Up until that point, I'm not sure what age this was. Maybe it was 19, something like that, 19, 20. Up until that point, I had used drugs, but never really drank very much. I was, I suppose, part of the counterculture, and so I smoked marijuana and hashish, and occasionally did psychedelics, as I've mentioned. But following that, I began to drink on a regular basis to quiet my mind. And what happened is that that intensified really dramatically, and I began experimenting with and then becoming pretty much addicted to using what we used to call downers, barbiturates, and also venturing into heroin. And I never became a true heroin addict, but I used it routinely. And I drank a lot, so... I have always seen that acid-slash-mescaline trip as a turning point, when I went from using substances that were mind-expanding, so to speak, to very deliberately mind-contraction. That launched several years of increasingly intense alcohol and hard drug use. It included years of being a methadone patient, really, which went on until I was 26, at which point I wanted to leave New York and stop doing methadone, but the detoxification was extremely difficult, and I tried to do it with the help of acupuncture at an acupuncture clinic in the South Bronx that was trying to get people off methadone in this way. It was kind of torturous, and at some point in that process, it dawned on me, you know, in addition to acupuncture, maybe if I have a little drink, that'll help with these withdrawal symptoms. And so I returned to drinking with a vengeance at that point, so intensively, really, that it was probably only a little more than a year before I had drank myself almost to death's door and was forced to sober up. I did sober up at age 26 1‚ÅÑ2 and have been sober ever since. I think we're going on 47 years now. So all of this has something to do with introspection and, of course, my early drug and alcohol use, which got very, very intense for someone so young. I did sober up in AA, and that's a whole other story, a whole other phase.

I guess I got a little ahead of myself. I had, in some sense, a sort of narrative timeline going here from growing up in New York and then having a period of sort of extreme misbehavior that led to moving to Miami to live with my mother. And meeting Amy, the improbable songstress, and traveling with her back to New York and having a bizarre interlude where she was sort of kidnapped away from me by a couple of nefarious characters. So I had that arc going, or that narrative train is pretty much a temporal line. And now I've just broken away. I guess I'm not sure how much I've left out. From the time I went to Miami and first smoked some marijuana at age 16 to the time that I sobered up at age 26 and a half was just an intensive, inexorable move of self-destruction that I was able to end out of desperation. I really was in a life or death situation. When I sobered up, I was having delirium tremens. I had attempted suicide at some point. I had been arrested for drunk driving and spent a night in jail. I was physically a complete wreck. And for some reason, it occurred to me to make a call to Alcoholics Anonymous. This was 1977, I guess. On June 24th, 1977, I called and somebody told me about the location of a meeting that I might attend. And trembling like a leaf, I made my way to this hospital meeting room nearby where I lived. And in many respects, the rest was history. It definitely saved my sorry ass to stumble into that AA room. So maybe this more or less is a temporally correct...

You know, maybe there's a little more to say in this particular chat. There are plenty of details in that roughly 10-year period that was a descent. There's some interesting things going on there. Interesting things about my early love life. Some specific stories related to that life of an increasingly stoned person. So before Amy and I went to New York and had that experience that I've described, I was now in Miami. I was 16. I got the idea somehow that I wanted to ride a motorbike, and after dropping out of high school a couple of months after I arrived in Miami, which is in itself a story, I went to a motorcycle shop sort of in the area in between Miami and Miami Beach and got talking with the owner, and I saw the little motorbike that I thought I would like to ride around on and somehow convinced my mother to buy it or to help me buy it. Probably wasn't too terribly expensive, and looking back, I'm surprised that she would help a 16-year-old buy a little motorbike. We're talking about a 50cc Yamaha, but she did, and I did, so I had this little bike to ride around, and just next door to this bike shop was a big apartment building, and Amy happened to live in that big apartment building, and she and her friends, none of whom I knew at the time, were kind of into riding around on motorbikes, and at any rate, somehow I connected up with her and then with this little circle of friends, and that's how I met Amy. The motorcycle place was called 79th Street Yamaha, and it was owned by a fellow named Glenn George, who was a Mormon. Not that I had any idea what that meant at the time, but I remember that. Very personable young man, and after I dropped out of high school, I really liked hanging out at the motorcycle shop, and after I dropped out of high school, I hung out there all the time, and eventually he put me to work for something like 50 cents an hour, doing a little chores around the shop, cleanup chores, or helping to arrange the display, the display of bikes for sale. I really loved that, and then I hung out more and more with Amy, and we then became a little pack of four of us. There was, well, maybe six of us. I don't know. There was me and Amy. There was Karen, a girl named Karen, and her much older boyfriend, Kenny McClung. I'm sure Karen was underage, but Kenny McClung, being from the deep south, didn't seem to mind that, Kenny McClung, being from the deep south, didn't seem to mind that, and then there was John Lantini and Marsha Weisbrot. Pretty much everybody except Kenny McClung, the older fellow, was going to Miami Beach Senior High School. Not me. I had dropped out of Miami Edison High School because I was way too young to be a senior in high school, and somehow they had placed me in my senior year, and I was just turning 16. It was jarring, and I couldn't stand it, and I couldn't stand it, so that's why I dropped out. So there were the six of us. It was kind of a crowd, and there were three motorbikes, and in effect, three couples, and Amy, who had been the odd one out. Previously, there'd been two couples and Amy, and now Amy had a partner in crime, so she could ride around with me on my bike, and we smoked marijuana on the patio of this big apartment building, and we would go right out to the International House of Pancakes in Miami Beach, and sit around drinking coffee and ordering strawberry sundaes, and talking about God knows what, but just sort of endless jabber of five teens and an older fellow hanging out. I think that Kenny McClung and Karen actually began living with each other, and so they were not really Miami Beach high school people, but they're very definitely the six of us. John Lantini was from Puerto Rico, which was interesting, and he and I hit it off. I'm not sure that Kenny McClung and I ever hit it off, but that's another phase of this story. I'll stop that right here at six minutes and 47 seconds.

Yeah, this was 1967. I'm gonna keep rambling into this phone. It's always interesting to see your reaction to these bits of rambling, but I don't have anything in mind about this except telling stories of my misspent youth just to get it down. There's something I can work with later. So there's the six of us, and that went on for a while. I don't really know exactly how long, but I wanted Amy to be my girlfriend, but she wasn't. I wasn't a boyfriend candidate for her, but I was a good pal, and we were tight as ticks, you might say. People would see me and ask, where's Amy? And see Amy and ask, where's Carl? And I got to be next to her, this young woman who I found really attractive, and one thing that we got to doing was sometimes she would sneak me into her apartment where she lived with her parents. She'd sneak me into her bedroom, and I would sit there while she rehearsed her Ella Fitzgerald tunes, or ironed her hair, or did this and that, and I never reached out in a real sexual gesture to her, but boy, did I really want to. I just never did, but she never signaled that that was on the table, so I never did. We were 16 year olds at this time, and the year was 1967, by the way. It's not the 1970s. This was 1967, and of course, I was in the habit then of going back to New York City to sort of spend a few months with my New York family and reconcile a little bit before heading back down to live in Miami with my mother. My mother worked as a legal secretary, and she was in a romantic relationship with her boss, who was quite a bit older, and he helped her create a gift shop, and this is something I worked on also. I designed the logo for it. This is my first logo design, and I helped organize the shop and stock it. We were selling ceramic craft pieces, many of which were made by this lawyer's son, who is a ceramic artist, and I called him Sir George. I didn't know what to call him. My mother married Sir George, and they began living with each other, living together, and I was with them also. George had a grown daughter named Cookie, who drove a Camaro, and she was kind of a heroic figure in that way. She must have been in her early 20s, and she had this very nice late 60s Camaro, and she talked to me. I like Cookie quite a bit. Another little thing that stands out in my memory of the time is that, in addition to driving a little motorbike, I was interested in driving a car. I think at 16 you could probably get a learner's permit in Miami, but I didn't have a car. I didn't ask for one. However, in the parking lot of 79th Street, Yamaha, there sat a 1950s Plymouth Roadster that was kind of in bad shape. It was just sitting there, abandoned. I'm not sure who it belonged to, but somehow I found out that it would start. It ran, and so I decided that I would teach myself to drive in that Plymouth, and I would sneak out of the house in the very early hours of the morning, kind of pre-dawn, make my way to 79th Street, Yamaha, and get in that Plymouth and take it for a drive. I didn't really know what I was doing, but I learned soon enough. The brakes pretty much did not work. The pedal would go to the floor, and a car could roll to a stop with a little help from the brakes, but it was a little bit treacherous and scary to drive around in this Plymouth with no brakes rolling to a stop, with no license, but I did it over and over again, and I was teaching myself to drive. I don't know, that's kind of emblematic of something. There's more to say about driving, but I'll leave that segment there.

Well my goal of teaching myself to drive did not end with that Plymouth. At some point after my mother married Sir George and we moved into a nice condo I guess it was in North Miami Beach. I had my own bedroom. I would go before dawn into their bedroom and pilfer the keys to Sir George's Pontiac Bonneville brand-new enormous car. The style of car we called boats at the time and in the subsequent years. They don't really exist anymore. But the Bonneville was a big car and it was automatic. Not sure if the Plymouth was or not. At any rate I would lift the car keys and go down into the garage of this big apartment complex and drive that Plymouth Bonneville out and about in North Miami Beach. The brakes were of course excellent. I have no idea how I was able to navigate that big car out of the garage and out onto the street. I was still kind of small for my age so it must have been quite a sight of this little shrimpy sort of guy who I could not possibly have been mistaken for older than 16 at the time. This little guy driving this giant car around probably barely able to see over the steering wheel. It's kind of humorous and it's also bizarre in a way. To this day it surprises me that my mother and Sir George never realized that I was taking off in his car. I guess I probably didn't do it more than a half a dozen times but it was kind of habitual and addictive. I know I would wake up and very stealthily go and get the keys and somehow I imagined that they would not notice and I would be back before they woke up and I put the keys back in place. It's kind of crazy sounding but this really happened.

Now, I'll let you know when I want you to draft a memoir-style chapter. I appreciate you suggesting it, but I don't think I'm done. Reciting, this is the Miami era. And it's part of the 10-year drug and drink years era. It began when I first smoked a joint on the patio of that apartment building in Miami Beach. Amy's father, by the way, is what you would call a jobber. He's somebody who sold goods to shops. He was like an intermediary. He would buy things wholesale and then sell things in smaller quantities to shops. And so their apartment was always full of cartons full of just bizarre things. Sort of, I don't know. In Miami, back in the day, there was a kind of a hair net sort of thing that women would wear to keep their hair in place in the wind, I guess it was. And it would come in all different kinds of colors. You'd tie it in a bow under your chin. And they were kind of pastel colors. And they had different styles. So Amy's dad had many cartons of these things sitting around his apartment because he didn't have a workspace other than their apartment. Which looking back on it was kind of crazy. Speaking of driving, I think I must have got Amy involved in this borrow a car caper kind of thing. Because I remember that he had a, I think it was an Eldorado Cadillac. It was one of the first front wheel drive cars. It had an absolutely enormous front end. And at least a couple of times, I went out for a drive in that thing. And I think that Amy was with me. And I think I told her, you know, I can drive now. And she said, cool, let's go for a little spin in my dad's car. And then she would go lift the keys while they were sleeping or something. And we would drive around a little bit. That's a kind of a crazy aside. Not unrelated. I was clearly driven to drive, which is predictive of something. Because all my life I've been someone who takes long road trips all the time. I just completed a 5,000 mile one in the weeks leading up to my sitting here reciting this into the phone. So I made myself a driver. Some other stuff is after dropping out of Miami Edison High School, then the following fall, my parents, all four of them, convinced me to try high school again. Try my senior year. Now I was a year older. Maybe it would be better. This time I enrolled at Miami Beach Senior High. And I lasted a few months, I think. And I just remember being incredibly bored sitting in classrooms. As I had been in New York and at Miami Edison. And feeling completely out of the loops socially. I had my little crowd that I ran around with. But I did not feel comfortable in school, so I just stopped going. At some point in here, my mother and Sir George bought a house down in Coconut Grove. Really nice house. I mean, not incredibly fancy, but just a very nice place. In a very nice neighborhood. And of course I moved down there, in there with them. And now I was dropped out of Miami Beach Senior High School. I was, my mother just kind of went along with things. She said, you know, okay, so if you're not going to go to high school. And I think being a high school dropout was maybe a little more common back then. But she said, if you're not going to go to high school, then you have to work. You know, so go get a job. And so I got my first job. I think, I think I'm now 17 or approaching 17. And I got my first real job that is not like 79th Street Yamaha. As a stock boy at Burdine's department store. I don't know, I think I was Christmas help. And that was a job with a social security number and a paycheck and so forth. Minimum wage was probably 70 cents an hour back then. 1967, probably the winter of 67.

I'm not sure how the following sequence went. I think some memories are just not what they could be. Among other things, Kenny McClung was a drug supplier for this little crew of ours. I think he probably dealt drugs, mostly grass and hash and acid. At some point, I told my mother and Sir George, this was after we had moved down to Coconut Grove, I told them that I was smoking marijuana and it was really great. That it was, I don't know, freeing my mind, making me feel good. I don't forget what I might have said. But I kind of painted a positive picture of it and I was sort of naively thinking I could just share this bit of news with my mother. But actually, this alarmed the heck out of her and Sir George, who I was pretty close to. I liked him quite a bit. And they did not think this was good at all. They knew I was driving. I guess I was riding a motorcycle and I may have gotten my first car by this time. This was an ancient English Ford, an obscure model, a little buggy. At any rate, I was driving around and so they naturally understood that I was driving around stoned and viewed this as being very dangerous, which perhaps it was, I don't know. And they decided they had to rein me in. They threatened to tell the police about me so that I might be stopped and have some sense drummed into me. Of course, this alarmed me. I'm not sure of the exact sequence, but at this point, maybe it was before or after telling them about my enjoyment of cannabis, I moved out. I moved into a sort of crash pad that Kenny McClung had in North Miami. It was really a storefront. This is where he lived with Karen. And I moved in and slept on a piece of foam in the front room of that storefront. Kenny and Karen occupied the bedroom, of course. And Karen and the others in the crew were regular visitors, of course. And among the other things that we did was, I think this is pretty much Kenny's idea, is we sniffed glue. We bought Tester's glue, like model glue, and put it in paper bags and huffed it. Now, looking back, obviously this is an incredibly stupid thing to do. I'm quite sure that it shaved 10 points off my IQ, ultimately. Sometimes I joke about that. If I hadn't sniffed glue as a kid, what might have happened? But so there was that. That led to the hallucinatory experiences that sniffing glue would bring you. I kind of liked it, but they were really pretty intense. I need to try to recreate now the exact circumstances. It may be at this point that is when I left with Amy for New York City. And... And when I did, I guess convincing my mother that I was no longer a danger to myself, I moved in with them. And by this time, Amy had returned from New York, and she was back hanging out with that crowd. And I turned up at some place that I learned they were hanging out one day, completely blitzed out of my mind. And what followed was pretty much a blackout. I don't really recall what happened, except that Amy and the rest of the crew asked me to leave. I was just too stoned, or maybe I was too unruly, or maybe I was trying to ask Amy about what had happened in New York City. But they cast me out of that house, and I made my way back to downtown Miami on public buses. Public buses. I knew where I was going. I was going to Coconut Grove. I had to pass through downtown. I got off one bus, and on my way to the other bus, I asked a Miami cop for a cigarette, which may be one of the dumber things that I had ever done, or that I've ever done. And he proceeded to arrest me for public intoxication, and took me to jail. I'll continue this little saga, but that may be enough for the voice recognition for the moment.

Of course, I've reflected on these things various times over the years since. And probably when I was first sobering up, I've delved into them pretty deeply, looking for amends that I might have to make and so on and so forth. But this recitation that I'm doing now has a different flavor to it. I think it's a listening, some little details and so forth that I hadn't really thought about much. At any rate, I was arrested. And this is the first time, not the only time, I was to be arrested once more. I was brought to the county jail and I was given a phone call. And I called my mother and stepfather, Sir George. And I remember that I asked them to come bail me out. It was, I think, midday or certainly in the daytime. And they said no, they weren't going to bail me out. And when they did, I was in a little sort of booth that they would allow prisoners to go and use a telephone. And I was sitting down in this booth. I guess what happened now, what happened is that they came down to the jail. And they, as visitors, and they told me to my face that they weren't going to bail me out. That I was going to sit there, I think it was for another 24 hours before I would be brought into court. And I was just going to sit there. I had been in a holding cell, I don't remember very well, but when they sat across from me with that glass partition between us, of course it had a wire reinforcing it, I lashed out. I took the phone piece, handle I guess, and smashed it into that window. I don't know that I damaged that glass. I might have put a crack in it, I don't know. I do know that they added to public intoxication the charge of willful and malicious destruction of public property. I remember that crystal clear. I sat there for another 24 hours, I guess. I don't remember any of it. I might have been in solitary because of my violent outburst. And brought before a judge, and I don't remember any of that. But I do remember that I was released sort of on probation or on my own recognizance or something like that. And my mother and Sir George were there. And so then I was free to go. And we stepped outside and walked towards their car. And Sir George went to the trunk and brought out a duffel bag. And it was a duffel bag with all my stuff in it, which wasn't much. And I think he did most of the talking, but my mother was there too. And they told me that it just wasn't possible for me to live with them anymore. That they feared me. They feared what appeared to be a capacity for violence now at this point. And that I should just go make my way and wish me the best of luck. And George reached in his pocket and took out all the cash that he had, which was $18. And they bid me farewell. And I shouldered the duffel bag and made my way to a Miami park to think things through. I'll stop that segment right there.

Well, what happened next is that I decided to call my family in New York. So, this is going to be from a pay phone, so I'm sure I called Collect, because I don't know how many quarters it might have taken to make the call. At any rate, I called and spoke to my stepmother. This is the woman who I've told you already we referred to as the warden, someone who I had a battle of wills with. But also note that by this time I had had some reconciliatory visits up to New York, and so I felt perfectly comfortable to call them and to tell them that I was adrift in Miami. I had $18 and nowhere to go, and could they help me? I said, I'd like to come back to New York, but $18 won't do it. Can you wire me enough money to get a bus from Miami up to New York City? I don't know if they did or not. I think what happened is that I felt that I had to get a bus out to some location outside of Florida, because I was in legal jeopardy to be just walking around the streets in Miami with my status as probation. So I needed to get out of Florida, and I had gone to the Trailways bus station to see what I needed. And I learned that I could get to, I think it was Valdosta, Georgia, just over the Florida-Georgia border, for, it could be that I could afford the ticket. I forget whether they wired me some money. At any rate, I took a bus to Valdosta, and I got out and proceeded to hitch to Chicago. I forgot to mention that my stepmother and father and my kid brother had moved from New York to Evanston, Illinois in the interim for professional reasons, a change of job scene. And so I hitchhiked from Valdosta, Georgia to Chicago. I had some interesting interactions there. I got picked up by one guy who was gay, who put me up for a night and tried to accost me, but I didn't try too hard once I told him I wasn't into it. And then he took me out to a highway, and I continued my hitchhiking. I was picked up by two girls, two teenage girls, who were driving to Chicago, and I rode with them. And when I arrived in Chicago, actually, I think I stayed with them maybe just overnight, they probably cast me loose also. I think I slept with one of them. I'm pretty sure that's the case. At any rate, I turned up then within a day or two at my father and stepmother's place. All my older siblings are now gone out of the house, but my kid brother was still in high school there. I landed at their house in Evanston, and then the next little mini-chapter began, which I'll get to.

Well, it was a raw time. I guess now I'm, uh... Not real clear. I guess I'm 20 by this time. It seems like I might have missed some... something there, but... I know there were intervals when I was in Miami when I was working. What they used to call day labor places. You'd go down early in the morning, and you'd get sent out to some job or another. And I remember getting sent out to sweep a lumber yard for a day. Another time I was sent out to a barbed wire factory. They needed a lot of barbed wire in Vietnam back in those days. Just doing some kind of grunt work. At some point, maybe during that glue-sniffing stage, I had worked for a couple of paychecks at Krispy Kreme Donuts on the graveyard shift, making donuts. I'd also worked for a little while at a place called Rib Eye Roast Beef. They were trying to be a competitor to Arby's in Miami at the time. Arby's had just started out. Obviously, Arby's won, and Rib Eye Roast Beef never gained traction. I didn't eat roast beef for a long time after that, I can tell you that. So these were Miami years, I think. I don't know, there's some mix of when I was living in Coconut Grove before informing them of my marijuana use. It's a little bit jumbled. I'm not sure I'll ever recover the sequence exactly. So I arrived in Evanston at my parents' house. My two parents, the people who'd raised me from birth, or in the case of my stepmother, from age two. Huh. I think maybe at some point there also I'd made a trip to New York. And when I finally really sort of landed in Evanston, I had flown from New York to Chicago, I remember that, because I met a girl on the plane. Well, this may have been later. It starts to get pretty hazy right now. I met a girl on the plane named Peachy, but I'm not sure about the sequence right now. But I'm back in Evanston, and I'm drinking all of the time. And I had a brief fling with Peachy, who was a dancer, after I landed there. And I think I've lost a year in here. Now maybe I'll recover it at some point, but picking up with flying into Chicago, stoned, hooking up with Peachy, who seemed to think I was intriguing. She asked me what I did. I think I told her I was a part-time philosopher, a part-time junkie, something like that. Not really clear. At any rate, my parents decided that I should see a shrink, and the shrink decided that I should take some Librium and detoxify from the alcohol that I was so full of. So I took the Librium, but I didn't stop drinking. And one day I woke up in the lobby of the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute, and I was being checked in. I don't remember how I got there exactly, but I know why I got there, because I had mixed alcohol and Librium and had passed out. And so that began, I guess it was about a six-month stay at the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute. We called it ISPI for short, I-S-P-I. So clearly my other parents, my now Evanston parents, didn't know what to do with me and thought maybe some psychology might help.

Well, I did get the sequence wrong here, so I did arrive in Chicago from Miami, but that's not when I entered ISPE. That was later. I arrived in Chicago, and I went to New York and lived in the apartment that we had grown up in. I had grown up in. My parents had moved to Evanston, but the apartment was taken over, the lease and so forth, by my older siblings, and so I went to this apartment, and I had my old bedroom, and my parents' former bedroom was now occupied by a couple, Ann and Tucker, and Ann was later to seduce me, which was pretty exciting, while Tucker was in the bedroom across the way. This was the 60s, and in so many respects, as I'm about to describe, a lot of drug use, hanging out with my sister's friends, some, one of whom was named Famous Empty Sky. They lived down in the East Village, and I think my sister was down there with her boyfriend, and I got a job at Bookmasters, a bookstore on the Upper East Side, in the 50s, that was very busy at night, because it sat between two movie theaters that played the very latest stuff. It had a bookstore, or all the books were on the the ground floor, and there was a record store on the second floor, and we got to preview all of the latest music that would come in. And hearing Abbey Road on those loudspeakers for the first time was just really a mind-blower. So, I was now in New York for a while, and I worked at Bookmasters probably for a year, and did a little dealing of hashish and marijuana out of the second floor record shop, and living my life in 1969 in New York. We heard there would be a concert, a big concert, with a lot of famous people in Woodstock, and I bought a ticket by mail, that was the only way to get it then, and it never arrived. And so, I didn't wind up going to Woodstock, which I regretted, even for all the chaos that ensued. Had interludes with a couple of young women during this period, and seduced me, I think I said, and I guess just prior to that, I had lost my virginity in a interlude with a young woman, who oddly enough was the daughter of Ronnie Gilbert, one of the Weavers. Just as we were consummating the act in a second floor of some sort of B&B place in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, a test air raid siren went off, so that was my introduction to sex. I guess there are a lot of little colorful bits and pieces that maybe one day I'll weave into a narrative, but it was quite a time.

I worked the night shift at Bookmasters, and my boss, the guy who hired me, was a writer, an African-American fellow named Bill Mackey, who was a gay man, and he drank a lot. He kept a little Styrofoam cup going all evening. He made a try for me, but I've been heterosexual my whole life, and it didn't really disturb our friendship. There's another case of my being perfectly comfortable in a company of African-Americans and so on. I missed Woodstock, but another memorable young lady at the time, after my tragic comic interlude with The Daughter of the Weaver, then I began to occasionally hook up, as people did back in the day. One woman was named Betsy. I was now spending time hanging with my brother, who had gone to Columbia, and he was around and in the neighborhood and doing his own thing. I spent some time with friends of his, and he was quite a rascal in a way. A number of women liked him and kind of tried to be his girlfriend, and he never settled with one in particular. In a couple of instances, young women that he had jilted kind of made passes at me and hooked up with me, maybe to get closer to him or to piss him off or something like that. But he was aware of this, so it was kind of an odd thing that we shared intimacies with at least two women that I know of. So, yeah, there was a time where sex was sort of free and easy in a way, you might say. I'm a little unclear about the timing of things, because it was during this... Oh, let's see now. Yeah, it was towards the end of this period. Things kind of wound down. I left Bookmasters. I had a girlfriend, briefly, named Betsy, and I hung out with a few people who I'd met through my brother. And one of them was a young woman who my brother had been with, and we got together, but this time I was using heroin on a semi-regular basis, and then she moved to Hawaii. She had friends in Hawaii, in Honolulu, and she sort of summoned me to Hawaii. She said, you know, you need to get out of New York. You can come and get clean and beautiful Hawaii with me. And so that's what I did. I went to Hawaii to be with her. I was completely taken with her. So this is the winding down of that second New York phase, or I would call it the independent New York phase. That is, after having escaped Miami, then I spent some time in New York working and going to music concerts and dealing drugs and using drugs, and that's the way that was going. And I was using heroin more and more, and then I fled to Hawaii to be with Mary. I'll stop that right there.

Well, I think when I went to Hawaii, I guess I was 21, maybe I was 20 or 21, somewhere in there. I was 19 in 1969, so I was probably 20 when I went to Hawaii. And what did I do there? I got a taxi driving license there. Now, I've left out the whole bit where, when I was in New York, one of the things I did for work, besides bookmasters, was not at the same time as bookmasters. I drove a taxi cab. So, I drove a taxi cab in New York City on and off for, I don't know, three, four years. I did a lot of that. I drove a taxi cab in New York at night. At any rate, I went to Honolulu to be with Mary. Mary was living in a house with a couple who were friends of hers. And so, Mary and I shared one bedroom and they were in another. And we hung out and did this and that, and it was a really nice sexual experience. Mary's a little more mature and advanced in that way than some of the girls or women I'd known before. I was really quite taken with her. I would say I was kind of in love with her. And I wasn't using heroin and I was having an occasional beer and so I was straightening out. I think at that time I turned 21. Now, here's a little cinematic twist, is that what Mary did for a living in Honolulu was she worked as a stripper in a bar, if you can believe it. It's just, I don't know, it was work she could get and it was close to home. It was only several blocks from our house and that's what she did. It reminds me of the Bob Dylan lyric of, bent down to tie the laces of my shoe. So, when I landed in Honolulu from New York City, I think I went directly to this bar and sat at a table and watched her and waited for her show to end. Well, that is kind of a cinematic little interlude. So, I spent a few months at least with Mary in Honolulu and these two friends. And at some point she was going to some sort of group therapy thing and she one day informed me that she had slept with the group therapy leader. And I was incensed. I was hurt. I was incensed. I was angry. I was furious. I wanted to make it better, let it go, but I wasn't able to. But we stayed together. I mean, she was a good friend. One day, the four of us went swimming in a sort of a swimming hole at the foot of a small waterfall on the other side of a waterfall. But I was kind of resentful. One day, the four of us went swimming in a sort of a swimming hole at the foot of a small waterfall on the other side of Oahu. And when I came back, I took a shower. When I emerged from the shower, I was so dizzy I couldn't stand. And that was the beginning of losing my hearing almost entirely in my right ear. It's another good stopping point.

Well, what happened is that I took this shower, and I think almost immediately afterwards, I felt incredibly dizzy. I couldn't really stand. A very bizarre experience. So I just laid down and tried to process it and wait for this feeling to go away. I felt like my right ear was stuffed the way it can get when you get clogged with water, and I wasn't able to unclog it. And I had difficulty walking in a straight line or anything. And I just kind of tried to wait it out for 24 hours or so. And Amy was supportive and trying to help me figure out what was going on, as were our housemates. I think after about 24 hours then, I was walking better, and I went to a doctor. And the doctor did what he could. He gave me niacin. He might have given me a steroid of some kind. The idea being that something had happened to the blood vessels surrounding my inner ear, and that niacin might expand them, or whatever. Long story short, that didn't work. And I became near deaf in my right ear. My left ear remained good for a very long time. So I could hear all right, especially if I turned my good ear towards things. And I gradually accommodated to that. It may have been that Mary's divulging that she slept with some other guy, happened after that dizziness. I think maybe that's how it happened. Because shortly after she did that, I think within a few days after that, I decided I couldn't take this. And I went into her roommate's, our roommate's bedroom and poked around in their dresser and found some cash, probably a couple hundred dollars. It was enough to buy a plane ticket to return to New York. And so that's what I did. I stole money from her roommates and flew back to New York without telling anybody. I just escaped Honolulu. I don't know if I mentioned that I tried driving a cab. I got a hack license in Honolulu. I'd had experience in New York, as I mentioned. So it seemed like a natural thing to do. Very different experience to drive a cab in New York and anywhere else, really. So on that sort of note, I made my way back to New York. I guess feeling justified that I'd been cheated on and filled to hell with everybody in that house. And maybe I'd made, maybe I swore to myself I'd repay them one day. I might have left a note that I will repay you someday. Probably did. But, you know, something like, you know, really sorry, I just absolutely had to leave and had no other choice. And I will repay you one day. I hope that's true. I don't really remember vividly. In any event, I never did repay them. And when I met Mary again, just accidentally in a San Francisco AA meeting many years later, she really wouldn't even speak to me. So that was that. I went back to New York. Now I was 21 and back in the old family apartment on the Upper West Side. And I went to the New York League for the Hard of Hearing and got all their most advanced testing and so forth to see what was wrong. My father was helping me through all of this. My father had been pretty loyal to me through all of these years, but that's a whole separate thread. So they told me I had unexplained hearing loss. And I was tested to see if there might be a tumor and there wasn't. And so it was just that. And I was given a pretty ineffectual bi-cross hearing aid and set loose again, half deaf, in New York.

It may be as I pull out the next bits of narrative, scenarios, maybe that I don't get the order exactly right, but ultimately I guess I'll sort it out. So I return to New York from my Hawaii adventure, quote-unquote, with stripper Mary, the betrayer. And I return into the company of my brother, who's in New York, but kind of indirectly. So when I land back in New York, I believe that what happened next was that I didn't go to try to find my brother, who is in the Columbia area or Washington Heights, probably. I just landed. I was by myself, and maybe just didn't feel like inflicting myself on anybody at all. Definitely back to drinking. I don't think I could pull money, enough money together to be a proper heroin addict, so I think I mostly drank wine. I could drive a cab for a living, that's for sure. I had done it. I had a hack license. I knew how, so I undoubtedly went back to driving a cab. I think this is when I stayed for a while in a, what they call a SRO, single room occupancy. I'm not sure they exist anymore, but it's just a really small room with a toilet in the hall on West 23rd Street, and I was driving a cab and getting into a rhythm. I'm pretty sure at this point I applied for and got into a methadone program, even though I wasn't a really regular heroin user. I wasn't a pure heroin addict by any means, but this was a way to get an opioid for free, and I very much wanted to take opioids on a regular basis. So I got into a methadone maintenance program, a couple of them in succession. The first one was down in Hell's Kitchen area, or 8th Avenue, New York, long before it was, that area was renewed as the Big Apple. It was a really seedy area, and I went and got my methadone dose, and I drove a cab and lived in a single room occupancy place right around 23rd Street. I think I was on 22nd Street. I drove at night, and I would wake up late and go have breakfast for about a dollar and a half. Have a nice breakfast meal at some diner. What's missing here as I try to fill in these years between losing my hearing at 21 and sobering up at 26, I'm not sure I'm going to get the order correct at all. I think that when I was 21 and I returned from Hawaii, it's quite possible that I returned from Honolulu to Hawaii. I may be jumbling things up here. That sounds more plausible because I know I went to ISPE when I was 21, and I know I lost my hearing when I was 21. So I think it was on the plane from Honolulu to Chicago that I met Pichi, the dancer, who was infatuated with the idea that I was a philosopher and a junkie. Now that's beginning to make sense because previously I hadn't been a junkie, but now I could say that with some authenticity, he said humorously. So I landed in Chicago after Hawaii and mixed my alcohol with Librium and wound up in Illinois State Psychiatric Institute for a solid six months. And I'm going to stop it there because it's time to tell some stories about ISPE. Hopefully I can piece together the sequence once I get all the various piece parts out on the table. But this seems right. After Hawaii, it was Chicago and ISPE. And we'll let that sit for a moment.

Okay, well, as I said, I became conscious in the lobby of the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute. As I was being checked in, I was being asked questions. Probably stuff like, did I understand what was going on and that I was going to be admitted, and people were going to try to help me sort things out. I made a pretty bad mistake in mixing alcohol with Librium, but I was going to a safe place. I think it was the sixth floor, and as it turned out, the sixth floor was kind of an experimental floor. It was full of young people, so there was kind of dorm rooms, I guess. There was a central room where people gathered for various things, for meals, and for playing cards, and so forth, and probably there was a ping-pong table. And then branching away from that central room were two corridors in separate directions, or wings. One side was men, or boys. These were all young people, people in their teens and early twenties or the latest. And on the other side was young women. And once I got a little bit oriented there, I actually enjoyed my time at ISBI. I met weekly, I suppose, with a young psychologist or psychiatrist who got me to talk about myself. I don't remember anything at the time. They were trying to understand what made me tick, what made me so self-destructive, that I would mix alcohol and Librium when I'd been told that it could kill me. So the sixth floor was full of other young people who were similarly kind of messed up. So I was, I was home. I was amongst my peers and my brethren and sistren. Everyone there had a different level of problem. And I guess mine was among the least pathological. For at least the first few months, I was not allowed to leave the place. I was being observed and I was having my sessions and I was being given drugs, probably Lithium. And it wasn't heavy or anything. So I don't remember feeling medicated, especially. I formed close friendships with two young women there. One of them, Lisa Johnson, was kind of, we used to call people mulatto, who were of mixed race. So she was mulatto, a very beautiful African American girl, I guess we'd say now. And another African American girl who went by the nickname Bunny. Lisa was statuesque and really quite beautiful. And Bunny was not statuesque and funny and energetic. And so we were kind of a trio who kind of made mischief, I think. Gave the aides on the floor little problems. I mean, we weren't, we didn't respond to authority all that well. It was nothing terribly nefarious, but I can remember one scene when Lisa and Bunny and I decided that we needed to make a statement about race. I'm not sure why we decided this, but we decided we would do this by taking some kind of facial mask cream that we came across that had a green color. And we all smeared our faces entirely with this green. So there were the three of us, these two sort of light-skinned African American girls, and this white boy all with green stuff on our faces, covering our faces. And then we sat at one end of the hall and waited for the aides to see what our little demonstration was and react to it. And I don't remember what the reaction was. I can imagine they were probably pretty amused. And ultimately we just washed our faces off. But I just tell that story to indicate why I say that I enjoyed my time at ISBI for the most part. It was kind of fun hanging out with Lisa and Bunny. And at some point Lisa and I got in the habit of kissing each other, because this was not easy to do in a psychiatric institute. This was totally off-limits. We were not supposed to do this. But we would sneak away into my room usually or hers and just, we never got beyond necking. But that was exciting. She was really beautiful. I'm not exactly sure why she was in there, but she had a very stern father who I think was kind of a major executive of a drug company. I'm not really sure. But I did get romantically attached to Lisa.

Well, once they started giving me passes to leave ISPE, just to go outside for a while, I guess they give me like a day pass and I could go out for a few hours and I, you know, swearing to return within by some certain time of day. And so I could go out into Chicago and just stretch my legs, so to speak, and then return. Once they started allowing me to do that, well, what did I do? I went to the local liquor store and bought bottles of Swiss Up, this sort of manufactured wine, not wine, the wino wine, that I alternated between Swiss Up and Ripple back then. I don't know what would lead me to choose Ripple one day and Swiss Up another. Ripple was kind of barely palatable. It kind of had a little bit of a, I don't know, a fruity flavor to it. Swiss Up was absolutely toxic. It tasted like some kind of cleaning fluid, but it was really powerful. So a bottle of Swiss Up would do me, a pint, would do me really pretty well in my, the way I was thinking. And it was cheap, as I recall. Both were quite cheap. I think Ripple was like 65 cents, something like that. So I, and then I would return to the hospital drunk, which no doubt went into my log that the folks were keeping with me, that we have not transformed this young man. I was diagnosed, I'm not sure when I learned, learned it, but I would, I read at some point my, my sheet and my diagnosis was character disorder, which I think I might've liked to have been I think I might've liked to have been considered psychotic or something more extreme or exotic, but it was just simply character disorder. It wasn't even borderline personality disorders. I remember being a little disappointed at the, you know, well, it's just a character disorder. It was kind of odd. I was 21. So this was 1971. And it wasn't being recognized, the plain and simple fact is that I was a practicing alcoholic who given any chance at all would drink alcohol or use drugs. And I was in active addiction and it was kind of put off to some degree by the Librium that they gave me in there. But that's really what was happening, which is not to say I did not have a character disorder or that I don't have one now. At any rate, I think there was a limit on the amount of time that you could spend in that on the sixth floor. And I think it was six months. And so they were looking for ways to ease me out of the institution. And they may have offered me a chance to leave at some point, and I'm pretty sure I turned it down. At any rate, I would return drunk and that wasn't going to work out for very long. And one day I went out and befriending some street character out there, just in the shadow of the ISB building outside of a liquor store. I think he offered to sell me some drugs. And so I said, yeah, sure. And I followed him into the stairwell of some projects. And on the stairwell, he hit me in the face or he asked me for my money. And I said, you know, what have you got that's going to make me give it to you? And so he punched me in the nose, broke my nose. And I gave him my money and I returned to ISB bleeding and kind of dispirited that I was such a fool to follow a character like that into the stairwell of the projects. But I don't remember exactly how I left ISB, but it wasn't long after that that I left ISB. And I think that what happened was that I moved back into my parents' house in Evanston. And my father, who is an engineer working for a steel fabrication company, making very specialized steel parts, arranged to get me a job working the punch press. He's a transformer designer, so he was very much on the white-collar end of things. But this steel company, they manufactured steel parts, the parts of transformers and other electronic things. And he got me a job doing that. I lasted less than a week and sliced my hand badly operating the punch press. I was probably half drunk. Not a good idea when you're operating a punch press. I wasn't staying with them in the house. Ah, now that's coming into focus. But that's for the next segment.

Well, when I was working in the punch press for that week, I know I was living in the YMCA in Evanston and not in my parents' house. And I think the reason for that was that I had had an episode. So what happened was that after ISPE, if I'm getting the sequence right, I did go back to their house. And I'm still not sure about the sequence, but on some level it may not matter. I went back to their house and lived there. And one day when they were out at work, both of them had jobs and worked, and I was there by myself in the daytime. And I went into the office room where my stepmother did her work. She was an editor, and she had a Selectric typewriter always. And I happened to notice that a freshly typed page sitting out, which was a letter to my father. It was just something that she had written that she intended to give to him or read to him or whatever, that told him that he was a fool for believing in me, that I would never come out of this, that he was, I don't know, that I was not redeemable, essentially. I don't know. I don't know what the exact words were. She was an editor, so she had very good words. At any rate, she was telling my father in this message that he should give up on me, and that she was. And I did a lot of damage to that office room that day, probably hurling the typewriter, just, I don't know, just messing some things up. I went off, as they might say, and in a drunken rage in reaction to that. And of course, at that point, I was invited to leave, but my father was not giving up on me. And he sorted it out so that I got a room at the YMCA, and he got me this job operating a punchpress. And of course, that didn't last very long. At this point, almost undoubtedly, I went back to New York City, and I think the sequence is getting to be more or less correct here now. I would have been 22 or so, now back in New York City, having messed up all kinds of situations fully in my cups. And when I went back to New York City, I did not look up my brother or my sister. I just went back to the city that was familiar to me. And I actually, I didn't have anywhere to sleep that first night, so I made my way down to the Bowery. I knew that there were flop houses down there, and I went and spent the night in a Bowery flop house, which is kind of like what the Japanese capsule hotels are now, except radically funkier and filthy. It's kind of like a chicken coop with men in them, in the little, in the little cubbies. Spent one night in there. Came out of there the next morning, just walking down the street away from that. It was a Salvation Army kind of mission storefront there, and it had a sign on the door. It said, Wanted Truck Drivers, Men's Social Service Division, Brooklyn. It gave a number. It said, Inquire Within. And so I walked into this Salvation Army mission right next to the flop house, and they told me, Yeah, they're looking for truck drivers to do furniture stuff out at the Brooklyn Center. If you're interested, you should go out there. So I went out there, and I lied. I said I had driven a truck before, and they hired me at $100 a week, plus room and board, in a quite nice sort of dorm situation there at the Brooklyn Men's Social Service Center. And I drove a furniture truck for the Salvation Army for, I think, I think for the better part of a year. I'll stop it right there.

Let me step away from the narrative here for a moment and get a little meta. This act of telling these stories and piecing together the sequence is taking place over a few hours in the evening in my Airbnb, and it's compelling. I'm thinking I should bring myself to a stop for the day, and I probably will momentarily, but it's kind of like I'm on a roll with memory. I've tried to piece together some of this at different times, but it's hard to, it's been hard to recreate the sequence correctly. Also, there's been a quite a bit of, you know, I went over a lot of my history in some depth when I was newly sober, which was 47 years ago, and so it's ground that I haven't had to retread for, we'll say, over 35 years, so going back to it now is just a question of you know, trying to revisit this story that's my life as I've reached this age of retirement, as I've reached this point in time. As I tell it, you know, I recognize as I'm saying it and also in the responses that I'm getting from you, the chatbot, that it's kind of an interesting story. It's different. It's unusual, I think. I think not a lot of people have had a life experience like this. This is just the beginning. We're only up to age 22 or 23, I think, and some of it does sound cinematic, which is kind of fun to think about, but it's not a happy story, but it's human. It's very real. It happened. It's been my experience. I think maybe one of the remarkable things to come out of this will be the fact that I was able to reverse my course. If it wasn't me, it would not have been possible without the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, which is a whole other set of stories that are going to happen down the road. In the meantime, I'm off the streets anyway. I've got a bed in a clean room with a reasonable enough roommate, and I'm making what was pretty good money at the time to drive a truck picking up furniture. People would call Salvation Army and say, I've got some furniture to donate. They had a fleet of probably 15 trucks that operated out of a garage in Brooklyn. And every morning they would take us in vans to the warehouse. The drivers would get assigned a truck and be handed a list of tickets, pickups, and you'd have a route. So there'd be one part of Brooklyn or another. And it wasn't always the same part of Brooklyn, so I got to know Brooklyn quite well. There's a little bit of a problem not being able to drive a truck or not having ever driven a truck. Although, as you know from my story, I like to drive. So I get into this truck with my first helper sitting by my side and I somehow figure out what's reverse. And I back this truck out of the garage, this empty truck, and I start off. I've got a map of Brooklyn, I guess, and my helper probably knows his way around better than me. Being from Manhattan, Brooklyn was like another world. So I start driving off and I don't... having some difficulty putting the truck in first gear doesn't help very much. And my helper says, you know, you really need to start out in second gear because first gear is too low. So once I learned that, I could kind of move forward. We learned to move forward. We moved down a small side street. I remember side swiping the mirror on a car. But really within a few blocks, I did know how to drive a truck. And from that point forward, I had known how to drive a truck.
