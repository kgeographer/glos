Here‚Äôs a grouped summary of all classes and relations actually used across your full nine-myth corpus, extracted from sample9.jsonld:

üßô Entity Classes (Types of Beings and Things)

These are used for entities like gods, people, places, and conceptual objects:
	‚Ä¢	myth:AdversaryDeity
	‚Ä¢	myth:AnimalMessengers
	‚Ä¢	myth:CelestialBody
	‚Ä¢	myth:Child
	‚Ä¢	myth:CreatedBeings
	‚Ä¢	myth:Creation
	‚Ä¢	myth:CreatorDeity
	‚Ä¢	myth:Deity
	‚Ä¢	myth:DeityGroup
	‚Ä¢	myth:DivineAssembly
	‚Ä¢	myth:Goddess
	‚Ä¢	myth:HelperCreature
	‚Ä¢	myth:Human
	‚Ä¢	myth:MythNarrative (container, not an actor)
	‚Ä¢	myth:MythicCreature
	‚Ä¢	myth:People
	‚Ä¢	myth:Person
	‚Ä¢	myth:Place

	‚Ä¢	myth:PrimordialSubstance
	‚Ä¢	myth:Seer
	‚Ä¢	myth:Son
	‚Ä¢	myth:Spouse
	‚Ä¢	myth:SupremeBeing

üìå New additions beyond the original list include:
	‚Ä¢	myth:PrimordialState, myth:PrimordialSubstance, myth:CreatedBeings
	‚Ä¢	Specific relational classes like myth:Spouse, myth:Son, myth:Seer, myth:Child, etc.

üï∞Ô∏è Event Classes (Narrative Moments or Actions)

These represent mythic actions or transformations:
	‚Ä¢	myth:ActionEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:AppointmentEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:AscensionEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:AssemblyEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:AttemptedAscensionEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:BetrayalEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:BirthEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:BlessingEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:CelebrationEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:ConflictEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:CreationEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:EmbodimentEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:EscapeEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:GiftGivingEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:GovernanceEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:GuidanceEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:InheritanceEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:JudgmentEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:PetitionEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:PunishmentEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:RescueEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:RestorationEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:ResurrectionEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:ReturnEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:RevengeEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:RitualEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:SacrificeEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:SeparationEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:SymbolicUnionEvent
	‚Ä¢	myth:TransformationEvent

üìå New event types include many refinements:
e.g. myth:AppointmentEvent, myth:SacrificeEvent, myth:SymbolicUnionEvent, myth:RitualEvent, myth:GuidanceEvent, myth:RestorationEvent

üé≠ Role & Event Properties

These describe the roles or attributes within events:
	‚Ä¢	myth:action, myth:actions, myth:activities
	‚Ä¢	myth:agent, myth:agents
	‚Ä¢	myth:assignees, myth:assigner
	‚Ä¢	myth:cause, myth:reason
	‚Ä¢	myth:children, myth:parent
	‚Ä¢	myth:decree, myth:role
	‚Ä¢	myth:featuresCreated, myth:material, myth:mediums, myth:method, myth:product, myth:products, myth:purpose
	‚Ä¢	myth:occasion, myth:outcome, myth:result, myth:resultingName
	‚Ä¢	myth:recipient, myth:recipients

	‚Ä¢	myth:itemsGiven, myth:symbolism
	‚Ä¢	myth:location, myth:substance, myth:subject, myth:target
	‚Ä¢	myth:participants, myth:patient

üìå You now have a rich vocabulary of semantic roles, many of which emerged naturally from myth structure.

üîó Other Structural Relations

These are relations not tied directly to events:
	‚Ä¢	myth:hasPlace

üìå Notably, semantic relations like myth:parentOf, myth:enemyOf, myth:created and others from your original schema were not used explicitly in the JSON-LD structure (though they are often implicit via roles and events).

‚úÖ Summary
	‚Ä¢	Your initial schema has expanded organically as myth modeling required.
	‚Ä¢	Event types are particularly diverse now, with many expressive subtypes.
	‚Ä¢	Entity classes have grown modestly, mainly through specificity (e.g., Spouse, Son).
	‚Ä¢	Role and event properties now offer rich vocabulary for querying and inference.
