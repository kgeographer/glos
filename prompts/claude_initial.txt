I am an academic geographer embarking on a new project called GLOS: Geographic Lens on Stories. The goal is to develop computational tools for comparative studies of folkloric text, focusing on folktales and creation myths to start. I do have considerable experience in older NLP methods (topic modeling, vector similarity measures, etc.), but limited experience with new machine learning and LLM methodologies.
In early explorations I have digitized the canonical folklore indexes - Thompson's motif index and Uther's tale types index, logged them in a postgres databases, generated embeddings for each, and built a simple tool to take any entered text generated an embedding for it, and return alternatively the 10 nearest neighbor motifs or 10 nearest neighbor tale types. I have begun recording geographic metadata for each but this is exceptionally difficult because locational information may be in the form of countries, historical regions, tribes, or languages; footprints for countries and modern provinces are straigthforward to come by but the rest are not.
The results of the simple nearest neighbor tool are interesting, but not really satisfying. The goal is to identify semantic/conceptual similarities apart from term co-occurence and efficacy is modest so far.
As a separate higher level experiment I have digitized a sampler of 9 creation myths from "Primal Myths" by B. Sproul, and have used embedding to cluster the 60-70 segments from the myths and asked an LLM model to summarize the concatenated segments in natural language. Again, the results are modest. The challenge is abstracting concepts from segments pulled from myths. This script also generates similarity measures for the 9 myths and visualizations of them; those are promising but somewhat 'black box-ish' as they derive from distributions of segment embeddings.
I would like you to consider all of this and propose some changes to these methods, or entirely new ones that help me create formal measures of concept content - perhaps leveraging the motif and tale-type indexes mentioned earlier. 
The overarching goal is to tie these comparisons to geographic locales, exposing similarities and differences in folkloric stories across cultures.
