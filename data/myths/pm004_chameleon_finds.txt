The Chameleon Finds
At first there were no people. Only Mulungu and the decent peaceful beasts were in the world. One day Chameleon sat weaving a fish-trap, and when he had finished he set it in the river. In the morning he pulled the trap and it was full of fish, which he took home and ate. He set the trap again. In the morning he pulled it out and it was empty: no fish.
"Bad luck," he said, and set the trap again.
The next morning when he pulled the trap he found a little man and wom- an in it. He had never seen any creatures like this.
"What can they be?" he said. "Today I behold the unknown." And he picked up the fish-trap and took the two creatures to Mulungu.
"Father," said Chameleon, "see what I have brought."
Mulungu looked. "'Take them out of the trap," he said. "Put them down on the earth and they will grow."
Chameleon did this. And the man and woman grew. They grew until they became as tall as men and women are today.
All the animals watched to see what the people would do. They made fire. They rubbed two sticks together in a special way and thus made fire. The fire caught in the bush and roared through the forest and the animals had to run to escape the flames.
The people caught a buffalo and killed it and roasted it in the fire and ate it. Then next day they did the same thing. Every day they set fires and killed some animal and ate it.
"They are burning up everything!" said Mulungu. "They are killing my people!"
All the beasts ran into the forest as far away from mankind as they could get. Chameleon went into the high trees.
"I'm leaving!' said Mulungu.
He called to Spider. "How do you climb on high?" he said.
"Very nicely," said Spider. And Spider spun a rope for Mulungu and Mulungu climbed the rope and went to live in the sky.
Thus the gods were driven off the face of the earth by the cruelty of man.
