The Great Gods
The world was created by one god, who is at the same time both male and female. This Creator is neither Mawu nor Liza, but is named Nana-Buluku. In time, Nana-Buluku gave birth to twins. who were named Mawu and Lisa, and to whom eventually dominion over the realm thus created was ceded. To Mawu, the woman, was given command of the night; to Lisa, the man, command of the day. Mawu, therefore, is the moon and inhabits the west, while Lisa, who is the sun, inhabits the east. At the time their respective domains were assigned to them, no children had as yet been born to this in though at night the man was in the habit of giving a “rendezvous” to the woman, and eventually she bore him offspring. This is why, when there is an eclipse of the moon, it is said the celestial couple are engaged in love-making; when there is an eclipse of the sun, Mawu is believed to be having intercourse with Lisa.
