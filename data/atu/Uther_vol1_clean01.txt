|1          The Theft of Fish. (Including the previous Types 1* and 1**.) A fox (hare, rabbit, coyote, jackal) lies in the road pretending to be dead. A fisherman throws him on his wagon which is full of fish (cheese, butter, meat, bread, money). The fox throws the fish out of the wagon [K371.1] and jumps down after them [K341.2, K341.2.1]. A wolf (bear, fox, coyote, hyena) tries to imitate this and pretends to be dead, too. The fisherman catches him and beats him [K1026]. Cf. Types 56A, 56B, and 56A*. In some variants one animal (rabbit, fox) pretends to be dead in order to distract a man who is carrying a basket of food. Another animal (fox, wolf) steals the basket. (Previously Type 1*, cf. Type 223.) Or an animal makes a hole in the basket so that the contents fall out. (Previously Type 1**.)

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 21, 41, and 158. 
Remarks: Documented 1178 in the Roman de Renart (I,1–151, V,61–120). A hu- 
morous episode in a cycle of animal tales. The second part of the tale is often  
missing from variants from northern and eastern Europe.

|2          The Tail-Fisher. A bear (wolf) meets a fox who has caught a big load of fish. He asks him where he caught them, and the fox replies that he was fishing with his tail through a hole in the ice. He advises the bear to do likewise and the bear does. When the bear tries to pull his tail out of the ice (because men or dogs are attack ing him), it is frozen in place. He runs away but leaves his tail behind [K1021]. Cf. Type 1891.

types, esp. 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 15, 41, 158, and 1910. 
Remarks: Documented in 1178 in the Roman de Renart (III,377–510). A humor ous  
episode in a cycle of animal tales. Also an etiological legend to ex plain why bears  
have short tails.

|2A        Torn-Off Tails (previously The Buried Tail). (Including the previous Type 64.) A fox (jackal, wolf) who has been tricked into losing his tail asks his companions to tie their tails together. When they run away suddenly, they pull each others’ tails off. The men (animals) in pursuit cannot tell which fox they were chasing, because now there are many foxes without tails [K1021.1]. Cf. Type 78. In some variants a fox who has lost his tail in a trap tries to con- vince other foxes to have theirs cut off. Often, he does not suc ceed [J758.1, cf. J341.1]. (Previously Type 64.) 

Remarks: The previous Type 64 is an Aesopic fable (Perry 1965, 424 No. 17).

|2D         The New Tail (previously Wolf [Bear] Persuaded to Turn in Wind). (Including the previous Types 2C and 40B*.) A wolf (bear) gets a tail out of flax (hemp) to replace the tail he has lost. A fox provokes him to jump over a fire. Thus the new tail is burned (the wolf himself is burned). (Previously Type 2C.) The fox tells the wolf to hold his burning tail up in the wind, but it only burns faster. The wolf is injured or killed. In some variants, the fox convinces the wolf to go to a smith to have a new tail welded on. The wolf is thus severely injured. (Pre- viously Type 40B*.)

|9         The Unjust Partner. (Including the previous Types 9A, 9B, and 9C.) A fox (jackal, monkey) and a bear (wolf, hedgehog, crab, bird) work their land together and agree to share the profits. While the bear threshes the grain in the barn, the fox rests, say ing he has to support the beams in the roof so that they will not fall on the bear [K1251.1]. (Previously Type 9A.) When they divide the harvest, the fox takes the grain and gives the bear the bigger pile of chaff [K171.1]. When their harvest is ground at the mill, the fox’s share sounds different from the bear’s [K171.2]. (Previously Type 9B.) Cf. Type 1030. When the fox’s grain is cooked it looks light, but the bear’s looks dark. In order to convince the bear that all the grain tastes the same, the fox secretly takes a spoonful from the bear’s dish and pretends it is from his own [K471]. (Previously Type 9C.) In some variants the animals have a race to determine who gets which part of the harvest. Cf. Types 275A–C.

|15         The Theft of Food by Playing Godfather (previously  The Theft of Butter [Honey] by Playing Godfather). A fox (cat, jackal) and a wolf (bear, mouse) live together. The fox pretends that he has been in vited to be godfather at a baptism (invited to a funeral or wed ding) but instead he secretly eats up the butter (honey) that he and the wolf have stored. This happens again (three times). When the wolf asks him the name of the baptized child, the fox makes up names that reflect the diminution of the stored food [K372]. When the wolf discovers the butter is missing he accuses the fox, who denies having taken it. The fox proposes a test to de ter mine who took the butter: both of them will lie in the sun and after some time the butter will melt and appear. While the wolf sleeps, the fox smears butter on him and thus “proves” his guilt [K401.1].

|20A          Animals Caught in a Pit Eat One Another Up (previously The Ani- mals are Caught in a Pit). (Including the previous Type 20.) A num- ber of animals (fox, wolf, bear, hog, rooster, hen, goat, cat, hare, mouse) go on a journey (a pilgrimage) together [B296] to seek their fortunes. They try to jump over a pit but fall into it instead. Cf. Types 130, 130B, and 210.     When they grow hungry, the fox proposes that they eat the one amongst them with the ugliest name (who can sing highest or loud- est, who can howl the longest, who is the youngest or the smallest).  Thus all the animals are eaten one after another, until only two (fox and wolf) remain or only the fox is left [K1024]. Cf. Type 231*.

|20C       The Animals Flee in Fear of the End of the World. (Including the previous Type 2033.) A chicken (cat, mouse) is frightened by a nut (acorn, leaf) that falls on its head [Z43.3] (tail), or another animal is frightened by a noise (a fart) [J1812]. The chicken thinks this is a sign of an approaching war (the end of the world, the sky is falling down), and flees in panic together with the rooster (they go to tell the king about the disaster). They meet other animals (e.g. goose, hare, dog, bear, wolf, fox) who come to share their fear and go along with them. The misunderstanding is cleared up, or the animals fall into a pit (see Type 20A). In some variants they arrive at the fox’s den. The fox invites them inside and eats them (see Type 20D*).

|20D*      Pilgrimage of the Animals (previously Cock and Other Animals Jour - ney to Rome to Become Pope). (Including the previous Type 61A.) A rooster wants to go to Rome in order to become pope [B296.1]. His wife accompanies him, along with more and more other animals. They meet the fox, who invites them to rest in his den. He asks them to sing and eats them one by one afterwards (see Type 20C). Often the fox pretends to go on a pilgrimage (to a convent). Other animals (chicken, duck, goose, magpie, sparrow) go along with him. The fox asks to hear their confessions or accuses them of sins which are characteristic of the different kinds of animals. Then the fox eats them as a punishment. In some variants the fox tells the rooster (partridge, lark) that he has become religious and repents his past actions [K2027], or he dresses as a nun [K2285]. Then he reproaches the rooster with his sins (his polygamy) and offers to hear his confession. When the roost er comes near, the fox catches him and gobbles him up.                    Or, the rooster escapes by a ruse. (Previously Type 61A.) Cf. Types 113B, 165.

The fox has concealed under his body (in his fur) the entrails (brain, eye) of an animal that he had killed earlier, and begins to gnaw on them. He tells the wolf that he cut open his own belly and is eating his own entrails [K1025, K1025.1.]. When the wolf tries to copy this, he dies.

|32         The Wolf Descends into the Well in One Bucket and Rescues the Fox in the Other. A fox (hare, hedgehog) falls or jumps into a well because he is thirsty (is fleeing from someone, or wants to trick the wolf into coming down) and sits in a bucket. He persuades the wolf (jackal) to get into the other bucket, and this lifts the fox’s bucket up to the top so he can get out [K651]. Often men find the wolf in the well and beat him.

|33        The Fox Plays Dead and is Thrown out of the Pit and Escapes. A fox (often together with one or more other animals) is caught in a trap (pit) and cannot get out. When the hunter comes, the fox pretends to be dead [K522]. The hunter takes him out of the trap and, thinking he will not move, lays him down. The fox runs away. Cf. Types 1, 105*, 233A, and 239. Other animals try to imitate the fox’s trick and pretend to be dead, but the hunter is not fooled a second time.

|34         The Wolf Dives into the Water for Reflected Cheese. (Including the previous Type 34B.) A wolf (fox, hyena, monkey) sees the moon re- flected in water (a well) and thinks there is a cheese (sheep, butter) lying under the water. He jumps in to get it [J1791.3]. Often another animal (the fox) persuades the wolf to do this. Cf. Types 1335A, 1336. In some variants the animal tries to drink up the water in order to get some cheese that he supposes is under it. He bursts. Or, the fox plugs him with a stopper just before he would have burst, and removes it when they come to an inn (a party). (Previously Type 34B.) Cf. Type 1141. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 15, 32, 41, 49, 49A, 74C*, 78A, 122, 122A, 123, 154, 175, and  
1530. 
Remarks: Documented by Petrus Alfonsus, Disciplina clericalis (No. 23) in the 12th  
century. The variant with the drinking animal appears in Marie de France, Ésope,  
No. 58 (cf. Perry 1965, 448 No. 135). With human actors see Type 1336.

When a wolf comes the fox tells him about the meat. The wolf goes to take it and falls into the trap. The fox is then able to eat the meat without danger [K1115.1]. In many variants the fox pretends to be fasting and thus says that he cannot eat the meat. When he eats it afterwards, he tells the wolf that the time for fasting is over.

|36        The Fox Rapes the She-Bear (previously The Fox in Disguise Vio lates the She-Bear). A fox (hare) asks the children of the mother bear (wolf, fox, lioness) about their mother and says he would like to sleep with her. The mother bear overhears this and lies in wait for the fox so she can catch him. He slips between two trees but she is caught between them, and the fox rapes her [K1384]. The fox uses mud to color himself black and comes back to the bear disguised as a monk [K521.3]. She asks him if he has seen the fox. He asks her if it was the fox who raped her, and she worries that all the animals already know what happened to her.

|37        The Fox as Nursemaid for the Mother Bear. (Including the prev ious Type 37*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A mother bear needs a nursemaid to take care of her children while she goes out hunting. Out of all (e.g. hare, wolf, ox, fox) who ap ply, she chooses the fox (hyena). Each time she goes out he eats one of her children, but makes sure that she does not notice that they are missing. After the fox has eaten all of the children, he leaves [K931]. In north European variants the mother bear requires that the ap- plicants sing well, and thus chooses the fox. In a few variants the fox and the goose raise their children to- gether and take turns minding them. The fox eats the goslings. (2) The applicants must sing to prove that they would be good hired mourners. While the mourning husband organizes the burial, the fox eats the corpse. (3) Instead of a nursemaid, a shepherd is needed for a herd of sheep. One after another, the sheep are eaten by the fox [K934]. (Pre- viously Type 37*.) Cf. Type 123B.

|38        Claw in Split Tree. A man (fox) asks a bear (tiger) to help him fell a tree (split wood). The bear is to hold his claw on a part of the tree. The man removes a wedge he had put there, so that the two pieces of wood spring back together and the bear is caught [K1111]. In some variants the bear asks the man for help, but the man says that the bear must help him first.

|40A*      The Wolf and the Bell (previously Wolf Has Tail Attached to Bell). (Including the previous Types 40 and 160***.) Cf. Type 110. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A wolf and a fox eat food that does not belong to them. The fox fixes a bell to the wolf so that, if anyone opens the door, they will be warned and be able to escape quickly. The wolf’s tail becomes caught in the bell cord (he is hung up on the cord). (2) A wolf forces a fox to give him food. The fox takes revenge by ringing a bell which betrays the wolf, or the wolf accidentally reveals himself by ringing a bell [K1114, K1022.4]. (Previously Type 160***.) (3) The animal that wolf and fox want to eat wears a bell, which the fox rings in order to betray the wolf. (Previously Type 40.) 

Remarks: Documented ca. 1190 in Roman de Renart (Branche XII).

|41        The Wolf Overeats in the Cellar. (Including the previous Types 33*, 33**, 41*, and 160**.) A fox (cat, jackal, hedgehog) convinces a wolf (polecat, hyena, antelope) to join him in breaking into a cellar (store- house, stable, kitchen, vineyard) to steal food. While they eat, the fox keeps checking to be sure that he still fits through the narrow exit. The wolf eats so much that he cannot leave. He is caught and beaten (killed) [K1022.1]. In early variants, a fox in a storehouse eats so much that he can not leave. A weasel advises him to fast. (Previously Type 41*.) Or, the fox pretends to be dead because he is so fat that he cannot leave the cellar without help. Thus he is able to escape. (Previously Type 33**.) 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 1, 2, 4, 34, and 100. 
Remarks: Documented by Jacques de Vitry, Sermones vulgares (Jacques de Vitry/ 
Crane, No. 174); then in 1178 in the Roman de Renart (XIV,647–843). The version  
with the fox and the weasel is documented by Horace, Epistolae (I,7) and as an  
Aesopic fable (Perry 1965, 425 No. 24).

|43        The Bear Builds a House of Wood; the Fox, of Ice. (Including the previous Type 1097.) In the winter, a fox (wolf, bear) builds him self a fine house of ice. A hare (wolf, fox, bear, sheep, goat) builds himself a house of wood (stone, iron, grass, wool). When summer comes, the fox’s house melts, and he goes to live in the hare’s house. He grad ually pushes the hare out [J741.1]. Cf. Types 80, 81, and 1238.

|44        The Oath on the Iron. (Including the previous Type 44*.) To settle a dispute (about their communal food supplies) a fox (hedgehog, sheep) proposes to a wolf that they swear on an iron trap (called Gos- pel) to tell the truth. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) The fox touches the trap delicately. The wolf hits it hard so its jaws snap together and catch him [K1115]. (2) A hedgehog wants to swear on a tree with a trap that is called a judge. When the judge does not answer him, a wolf pushes the trap so hard that he is caught in it. (3) A wolf wants to skin a sheep, but a fox, who is the sheep’s friend, makes the wolf promise not to harm him. He swears by kiss- ing a trap, and is caught in it. (Previously Type 44*.) (4) A sheep proposes to swear on a bush in which a dog is hiding. The dog attacks the wolf. 

Remarks: Documented in the middle of the 12th century in Ysengrimus (VI,349–

|47A       The Fox Hangs Onto the Horse’s Tail (previously  The Fox [Bear, etc.] Hangs by His Teeth to the Horse’s Tail, Hare’s Lip). (Includ ing the previous Type 47C.) A fox (wolf, bear, monkey, several animals) runs into a seemingly-dead horse (donkey, dog) and (on the advice of another animal) wants to take the carcass home for food. He ties (bites) himself to the dead animal’s tail [K1022.2, K1047] and starts to drag it home. The horse jumps up and runs away, dragging the fox to his master, who beats (kills) the fox. Or, the fox persuades the wolf to tie a rope around the wolf’s neck and the other end around the animal they want to eat. The wolf is strangled. (Previously Type 47C.) Cf. Types 1875, 1900. Often the animal only pretends to be dead, in order to catch the fox. Sometimes the hare witnesses the event and laughs so hard that his lip splits [A2211.2, A2342.1]. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 47B, 122A, and 154. 
Remarks: Documented ca. 1200 in the Roman de Renart (IX,1586–1903). The vari ant  
of Heinrich Steinhoewel, Esopus (7. Extravagante, No. 87) has been very in fluential.  
Also an etiological animal tale, why the hare has a split lip.

|47B       The Horse Kicks the Wolf in the Teeth. (Including the previous Types 47E and 122J.) A wolf (lion) wants to eat a horse (mule, donkey, foal). Before the horse will let himself be eaten, he demands that the wolf does him a favor, e.g. take a thorn out of his foot, remove his iron shoe, or read his name (his genealogy [J954.1], age, selling price) which is printed on the bottom of his hoof. Or, he asks to be eaten from his hindquarters forward. When the wolf approaches his hoof, the horse kicks him [K566, K1121]. Sometimes a fox persuades a wolf to look for a horse’s name (genealogy) under his hoof. Or, the wolf asks God to give him some- thing to eat, or pretends to be a doctor and examines the horse’s hoof [K1955, K1121.1]. In some variants a lion sends a wolf and/or a fox (jackal) after a donkey (horse, camel), who is absent from the parliament of the animals. When they ask why he did not attend, the donkey says he has a charter under his hoof that excuses him. When the wolf attempts to read the document, the donkey kicks him [J1608, K551. 18]. (Previously Type 47E.) 

Combinations: 122A–122N*. 
Remarks: Aesopic fable (Perry 1965, 457 No. 187, 587 No. 693, 593ff. No. 699).  
Documented in the 13th century in the Roman de Renart (XIX,1–90). The motif of  
the donkey’s charter under his hoof is documented by Jacques de Vitry, Sermones  
vulgares (Jacques de Vitry/Crane, No. 33) in the 12th century.

The monkey gives a flatter ing answer so that the lion will not kill him. Later the lion pre tends to be sick and claims that he needs monkey meat to be cured, so the monkey is killed after all.

|52        The Donkey without a Heart. A lion (tiger, wolf) wants to eat a don- key (deer, ram, camel). A fox (jackal, hedgehog) persuades a don- key to go with him to the lion (to go into the service of the king of ani mals). On the first approach, the donkey runs away, but the fox persuades him again and the lion kills the donkey. The fox secretly eats the donkey’s heart (ear, brains). The lion notices that the organ is missing, but the fox claims that this donkey never had a heart, because if he had one, he would not have let himself be deceived [K402.3]. In variants from central Asia, a wolf, a bear, and a fox catch a camel who lets himself be eaten. While the bear and the wolf clean (butcher, transport) the carcass, the fox eats the heart (brains, in- testines). He tells the wolf that the bear ate it. While the bear and the wolf fight, the fox runs away with the meat. Cf. Types 785, 785A.

|55        The Animals Build a Road (Dig Well). The animals (birds) decide (are commanded by God) to build a road (well, reservoir). One ani- mal (mole, mouse, snake, crab, swallow, raven, oriole) refuses to help because he thinks he can go where he wants without it (can always find enough water). The animals prevent him from going to the well [A2233.1], or he is killed when he crosses the road [A2233. 1.2, A2233.1.3] [Q321].

|56A       The Fox Threatens to Cut Down the Tree and Gets Young Birds (prev- iously  The Fox Threatens to Push Down the Tree). A fox (jackal) threatens to cut down the tree (using his tail as a saw) of a mother bird (magpie, woodpecker, dove, thrush, nightingale) unless she will throw down to him one of the chicks (eggs) which are in her nest [K1788]. Thus the fox eats one of the chicks every day. When only one is left, the mother tells another mother bird (crow, magpie) about her misfortune. This bird replies that a fox cannot cut down a tree. The mother refuses to give the last chick to the fox, who de cides to take revenge on the neighbor bird. When he sees her, he pretends to be dead. The bird approaches him, and the fox kills and eats her [K751, cf. K827.4]. Cf. Type 1.

|56B       The Fox (Jackal) as Schoolmaster (previously  The Fox Persuades the Magpies into Bringing their Young into his House). (Including the previous Types 56C and 56D*.) A fox (jackal) persuades a bird (magpie, woodpecker, dove) or a crocodile (wolf, leopard, hyena) to let him educate her children [K1822.2]. The fox eats them [K811, K931.1]. When the mother comes to visit them, the fox says they are not there (shows her one that is still alive). After a while the mother discovers what has happened. She goes for help to a dog (wolf). The dog pretends to be dead (lures the fox into a trap) and kills the fox [K911]. Cf. Type 37. Or, the fox leaves before the mother can take revenge. (Pre viously Type 56C.) In some variants the fox baptizes the hen’s children and becomes their teacher. Then he eats them. (Previously Type 56D*.)

|57        Raven with Cheese in His Mouth. A fox flatters a raven (crow), who is carrying a piece of cheese (meat, breadcrust, a grape) in his beak, by complimenting him on his beautiful singing voice. The raven wants to sing to the fox and drops the cheese. The fox grabs it and gobbles it up [K334.1, cf. A2426.2.6]. In some variants, the fox provokes the raven by saying that it is too bad that such a beautiful bird as he is, is unable to sing.

|58        The Crocodile Carries the Jackal. A rabbit (jackal) wants to cross a river in order to get some food (because he is invited some where). He persuades a crocodile (camel) to carry him across on his back. During the ride, the rabbit declares that the crocodile stinks (the camel  is chased on the opposite bank by men). On the return trip, the crocodile, offended, lets the rabbit drown. Occasionally the rabbit escapes. In some variants a monkey (fox) declares that he has been com- manded to count the crocodiles. He orders them to lie in the river next to each other [B555]. He counts them by walking on their backs and is able to cross the river [K579.2].

|59        The Fox and the Sour Grapes. A fox (cat, bear, jackal) cannot reach some grapes (pears, rowanberries, pomegranates, flesh, cheese). He persuades himself that they are not ripe enough to eat (that they stink, or that he cannot eat them because it is a fast day) [J871]. In some variants the fox tries in vain to pick some pears. He follows after a donkey, hoping that his testicles, which he thinks are pears, will fall off so he can eat them [J2066.1]. When this does not happen, the fox tells himself that they were black and smelly. Cf. Type 115. In Iberian variants, the fox wants to steal fruit at night and asks for some light so he can see it. He is nearly caught by a hunter. The fox says he did not want that much light. Cf. Type 67. 

Remarks: Aesopic fable (Perry 1965, 424 No. 15). Ca. 1200 documented in the  
Roman de Renart (XI,257–333). Popular as a proverbial phrase.

|60        Fox and Crane Invite Each Other. A fox (jackal, wolf, cat) invites a crane (stork, woodpecker, heron, crow, snipe) to dinner. He serves him soup (milk, mush) in a shallow dish, and the crane cannot eat the food. The crane invites the fox to dinner in return, and serves the food in a bottle (tall jar), or he strews peas on the floor. In this case the fox cannot eat the food [J1565.1]. In some variants the stork invites the fox first, so that the two parts of the tale are reversed.

|61         The Fox Persuades the Rooster to Crow with Closed Eyes. A fox meets a bird (rooster, partridge) whom he persuades to sing (dance) for him. He asks the bird to close its eyes as his father had always done (the fox comes near the bird, pretending that he cannot under- stand it). The fox grabs the bird [K721, K815.1]. Cf. Type 56D. In many variants, the bird, caught in the fox’s mouth, induces him to speak, e.g. to say grace before he eats or to tell someone what he has caught. When the fox opens his mouth, the bird escapes [K561.1]. Cf. Types 6, 122A, 122B*, 227, and 227*.

When the cat goes out to hunt, he warns the rooster not to open the door to the fox (not to show himself at the window). (Cf. Type 123.) The fox comes and lures the rooster out (by offering him a ride on his tail). When the cat comes home and sees that the rooster is gone, he goes to the fox’s den. He entices the fox’s children with songs (poet- ry), eats them, and rescues the rooster [K815.15]. In some vari ants the rooster has already been eaten by the fox. Or, the cat rescues the rooster once or twice from the fox, but the fox catches him on a later attempt.

|62         Peace among the Animals – the Fox and the Rooster. A fox (jackal) wants to catch a rooster (dove, titmouse, swallow, fish) who is up in a tree (on a dunghill, roost, in the sea) where he cannot reach it. In order to lure the rooster, the fox announces that it has been decreed that all animals are united in peace. The rooster is dubious. The rooster tells the fox that two dogs are coming their way and that maybe they are bringing along the proclamation of peace. The fox is about to run away, and the rooster asks why. The fox says that he is not sure whether the dogs know about the treaty [J1421, K579.8, K815.1.1]. In some variants the fox offers the bird a kiss to celebrate the peace treaty, and promises to close his eyes if the bird is afraid. The bird comes near the fox’s mouth and is eaten. Or, the fox offers to pray along with the rooster. The rooster wants to wait until the Imam, who is a dog, arrives. The fox runs away, claiming he forgot to wash in preparation for prayer.

|65        The  She-Fox’s  Suitors.  This  tale  exists  chiefly  in  three  different forms: (1) In order to test his wife’s devotion, an old fox pretends to be dead. The widow rejects the first suitors who come to her because none of them has nine tails, as her husband had. Finally a suitor comes who has nine tails, and the widow agrees to marry him. The old fox who was supposed to be dead comes to the wedding [N681]. He beats his wife and her suitor and sends them out of the house [T211.6]. (2) An old fox is truly dead. One after another, the wolf, dog, stag, hare, bear, and lion (other wild animals) come to woo the widow. Only the young fox has a red coat and a pointed snout, so it is he whom she marries. (3) In Hungarian variants an old widower marries a she-fox, and they invite other foxes to their wedding. The widower pre tends to be sick and asks for an axe to put under his pillow. Believing her groom is dead, the bride invites more and more guests. A hare notices that the husband is alive but is unable to warn the others. The old widower catches them, kills them, and skins them. Cf. Type 1360C.

|66A        “Hello, House!” An animal (crocodile) wants to catch a weaker animal (jackal, monkey) and hides in wait in its den. When the jackal comes home he smells danger (sees tracks going into his den but not coming out). He calls out several times, “Hello, house!” When no one replies, the jackal announces that usually the house answers him. The animal in the den then answers, and the jackal knows that someone is in his den. He runs away (kills the intruder) [K607.1, K1722]. Cf. Type 50A.

|68        The Jackal Trapped in the Animal Hide. A jackal (gopher) climbs inside an elephant (through the anus) and eats it from the inside [cf. F929.1]. The elephant dies and the jackal is unable to get out because of the shrunken carcass. He induces the rain god to make rain, and, when the water bloats the carcass, the jackal is able to climb out [K565.2, K1022.1.1]. In some variants, the elephant lets the jackal climb in to share the water which the elephant has drunk. Once inside, the jackal begins to eat the elephant’s flesh [K952.1.1]. In other variants, the elephant is already dead when the jackal climbs inside it. The elephant’s children open the dead animal to find out why it died. They discover a hyena and a gopher inside [J2136.6.1]. The gopher claims that the hyena alone caused the animal’s death.

|75        The Help of the Weak. Cf. Type 233B. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A lion (tiger, bear, elephant) catches a mouse (squirrel, rat) (the mouse disturbs his sleep). The mouse begs for its freedom and promises to come to the rescue of the lion in the future. The lion laughs but sets the mouse free. Later, when the lion is caught in a net (pit, or tied with a rope), the mouse comes and gnaws him free (fills the hole with sand) [B371.1, B363, B437.2]. (2) A mouse (rat) runs under a net where a cat is also caught. When the danger is past, the mouse gnaws the net to free the cat out of gratitude that the cat did not eat him. The mouse says he regrets that a longer friendship between the two of them will not be pos sible  [J426, cf. B545.1]. (3) A lion asks a mouse to rescue him from a net. In return, the mouse asks to marry the lion’s daughter. The lion at first refuses but then agrees to the marriage. The lioness (accidentally) treads on the mouse. Cf. Type 233B.

|81        Too Cold for Hare to Build House in Winter. A hare (dog, lark, grouse ) freezes during the winter. He vows to build a house the next sum- mer, when it is warmer. In summer, when it is sunny, the hare is too lazy and tells himself that last winter he went without a house [A2233.2.1]. Or, a dog curls up tight as he shivers in the winter. He prom- ises himself to build a little hut during the summer. When summer comes, he discovers that he stretches out so long, he would need a big house. This would be too much work for him, so he builds no house at all. Cf. Type 43.

|85         The Mouse, the Bird, and the Sausage. (Including the previous Type 247*.) A mouse, a bird, and a sausage (shrimp) live together sharing the housework. The bird gathers wood, the mouse carries water, makes the fire and sets the table, and the sausage does the cooking and flavors the food by jumping into the pot. The bird complains that his work is the hardest, so they exchange duties. The bird drowns in the well, the sausage is eaten by a dog while gathering the wood, and the mouse is scalded to death when it jumps into the pot to flavor the soup [J512.7]. Or, the mouse (chicken) and sausage live together. While the mouse  goes to church on Sunday, the sausage cooks their dinner. One Sunday they change roles, and the mouse is scalded to death when it tries to flavor the soup.

|91      Heart of Monkey as Medicine (previously Monkey [Cat] who Left his Heart at Home). A monkey (fox, jackal) and a turtle (crocodile, fish) are friends. The turtle’s wife becomes jealous and pretends that she has an illness which can be cured only if she eats the heart of a monkey. The turtle meets the monkey and swims into the sea with him on his back. On the way he tells him about his wife’s problem. The monkey sympathises but says he has left his heart in a tree. When the turtle takes him back to the land to get his heart, the monkey runs away [K544, K961.1]. In some variants, the illness of a king (princess) can be cured only by the liver of a rabbit. When one is caught, it pretends to have left its liver at home and offers to go and get it. Then it runs away.

|93         The Master Taken Seriously. This tale exists chiefly in two differ ent forms:  (1) A mother fox and her children hear the owner of a vine yard in which they live cursing them. They do not leave until he begins to cut the vines.  (2) A bird and her young have their nest in a field of grain. When the farmer asks his neighbors to help with the harvest (the farmer’s sons begin to harvest the field), the birds remain in their nest. They leave  only  when  the  farmer  himself  begins  to  harvest  the  field [J1031].

|113A      Pan is Dead (previously King of the Cats Is Dead). A man (dwarf) hears a voice (of a cat) that tells him to announce that a third figure (the god Pan, the king of the cats) is dead. The man does not recog- nize either the voice or the name of the dead person. When he comes home he tells what happened. When the maid (cat) hears this, she says she has to leave (is now the new king of the cats), goes away, and never comes back [B342]. In some variants a man kills a cat that follows him. Before she dies, the cat tells the man to inform a particular person of her death. When the man comes home and tells what happened, his own cat kills him.

|123        The Wolf and the Kids. A wolf comes while a mother goat is away, hoping to eat her kids (kid). When they do not open the door, the wolf changes his voice [K1832, K311.3] and colors his paws with flour [K1839.1]. The children believe that it is their mother and they open the door. The wolf eats the kids (all except one). The youngest kid hides in a clock. The mother returns and takes revenge on the wolf. She finds him asleep, cuts her children out of his belly [F913], and fills it with stones [Q426]. Or, she challenges him to a fight, which she wins. Or, she invites him to her house where he falls into a pit of hot coals. Cf. Types 333, 705B, 2028. In older variants the kid obeys his mother and does not open the door [J144].

|124       Blowing the House In [Z81]. (Including the previous Type 124A*.) A goose builds a house of feathers, a hog one of stone. A wolf (bear) blows the goose’s house down and eats her. He cannot blow down the hog’s house. He tries to lure the hog but the hog outwits him: e.g. the wolf suggests they steal apples together (go to the market) but the hog goes earlier so that the wolf cannot eat him. Finally the wolf tries to get into the house through the chimney. He is burned or scald ed with boiling water [J2133.7, cf. K891.1.]. Cf. Type 43. Or, three pigs build one house of straw, one of sticks, and one of iron. The wolf destroys the first two houses and eats the pigs but the third pig is able to outwit him. (Previously Type 124A*.)

|150       The Three Teachings of the Bird (previously Advice of the Fox). In return for his freedom, a bird (fox) gives a man three pieces of advice: first, “never try to reach the unattainable” [J21.14], second “Do not regret a thing that is past” [J21.12], and third, “Never believe what is beyond belief” [J21.13]. The bird tells him a lie. The man regrets having freed the bird, and the bird says that the man learned nothing from the advice [K604]. In some (parodistic) variants a fox promises three pieces of ad- vice to a ferryman. As they cross the river the fox offers two trivial aphorisms. When they reach the bank, the fox, as the third piece of advice, tells the ferryman that he will never get rich if he transports everyone so cheaply.

|154        The Fox and His Members (previously “Bear-food”). (Including the previous Type 160B*.) A man in anger calls his horse “bear-food”. A bear comes and threatens to eat the horse [C25]. A fox agrees to help the man against the bear in return for geese. The fox goes into the forest and imitates the barking of dogs. The bear is intimidated and killed. The man pretends to go for the geese but instead brings dogs back in his bag [K235]. The dogs chase the fox to his hole. Here the fox asks his feet, eyes, ears, and tail how they helped him in his flight. His tail admits that it did not help. As a punishment the fox sticks out his tail and is attacked by dogs [J2351.1]. In some variants a hare asks his members about their help in his flight [U242.1]. (Previously Type 160B*.)

|155       The Ungrateful Snake Returned to Captivity. A man rescues a snake (wolf, bear, tiger) from a trap. In return the snake seeks to kill the rescuer [W154.2.1]. Other animals are asked if a good deed should be repayed with a bad one. The fox, as judge, asks the snake to show how it was trapped. The snake is tricked into captivity [J1172.3]. Cf. Types 331, 926A. In some variants a man warms a cold snake. The ungrateful snake bites the man and he dies.

|156       Androcles and the Lion (previously Thorn Removed from Lion’s Paw [Androcles and the Lion]). (Including the previous Type 156A*.) A shepherd pulls a thorn out of a lion’s paw. When the shepherd is thrown as a punishment into a pit of lions, the lion recognises him and licks his hand instead of tearing him to pieces. The emperor releases both [B381]. Or, a bone is removed from an animal’s (wolf, tiger, bear) throat, and later the animal shows gratitude to the rescuer [B382]. (Pre- viously Type 156A*.) Cf. Type 76.

|177        The Thief and the Tiger. A tiger overhears a person saying that he fears something worse than the tiger. The word is unknown to the tiger (dripping of rain, sweet, twilight). Thinking it must be a terrible thing, the tiger hides (sometimes among sheep) and is found by a drunken man (thief) who mistakes him for his horse. He rides off on the tiger [J2132.4, cf. N691.1.2] (steals it because it seems to be a very big sheep [N392]). The tiger thinks the man must be the terrible thing he has heard about and meekly submits. In the morning the man sees his mistake and flees. Cf. Type 1692.

|181      The Man Tells the Leopard’s Secret (previously The Man Tells the Tiger’s Secret). A lizard and leopard (tiger) play hide and seek. The lizard fastens himself (a crab) onto the leopard’s tail or coats himself with mud so that the leopard cannot grab him. A man witnesses their contest. The leopard is ashamed [J411.10] and threatens him unless he maintains silence. The man betrays the secret and the leopard carries him off. The man escapes by making a noise so that the leopard thinks that the lizard is coming [K1715.5], or by saying he has eggs from which lizards will soon hatch.

|200B      Why Dogs Sniff at One Another. This tale exists chiefly in two differ- ent forms: (1) Animals arrange a banquet and discover that the pepper is missing. One dog is sent to buy some but he does not return. Since then dogs sniff at one another to find that dog. Or, a dog is sent to get some medicine and does not return. (2) Some dogs are sent to heaven for an audience and, while wait- ing, they shit in heaven and are chased away. The next time spices or perfume are attached under their tails, but again they are chased away. These dogs do not return to the other dogs, who continue to look for the missing dogs by sniffing under each other ’s tails [A2232.8, Q433.3]. Cf. Type 200A.

|222A       The Bat in War between Birds and Quadrupeds (previously Bat in War of Birds and Quadrupeds). Because of its ambiguous form the bat joins first one side and then the other, but it always takes the side of the winner. The animals notice this when they make peace. Consequently, the bat is despised by all animals [B261.1]. Often used to explain why bats fly only at night [A2491.1].

A jackal (fox) orders a bird (often a lark) to obtain food. The bird flies near men carrying baskets of food. The men drop the baskets to pursue the bird and the jackal eats the food. The jackal orders the bird to make him laugh. The bird lands on the heads of two men so that they fight with one another [K1082.3]. The jackal orders the bird to make him cry. The bird leads men or dogs to the jackals’s hiding place. The jackal orders the bird to save his life. The bird lures the jackal to a crocodile, then strikes the crocodile so that the jackal is able to escape. Cf. Type 248.

|225A      The Tortoise Lets Itself be Carried by Birds (previously Tortoise Lets self be Carried by Eagle). A tortoise is carried up into the air by two birds (herons, geese, swans) who hold onto a stick which the tortoise holds in its mouth. When it speaks, it loses its grip and drops to its death [J2357]. Or, a bird (eagle) takes the tortoise into the air, drops it so that it smashes, and eats it [J657.2, A2214.5.1]. Sometimes  used  to  explain  why  the  shell  of  the  tortoise  has cracks.

This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) Sun, frost (moon) and wind meet a farmer who greets one of them. They cannot decide who is being addressed and ask the farm er. He answers that he intended to address the wind because it protects him from severe heat and cold. (2) Cold and wind compete for supremacy and ask a farmer’s opi nion. The farmer favors the wind. The cold wants to take revenge for this answer, but the wind helps the farmer so that he does not loose his harvest. (Previously Type 298B*.) Cf. Type 846*. (3) Cold and wind quarrel about their strength. The wind over- comes the frost. (Previously Type 1097*.) Cf. Type 71.

|298C*     The Reeds Bend before Wind (Flood). A reed and an oak argue which is the stronger. The reed wins because it saves itself by bending in the wind, while the oak is uprooted [J832]. In some variants a thornbush tells a beautiful pine tree that in the future when the pine tree is cut down, it will be happy to change places with the thornbush. 

Remarks: The first part is an Aesopic fable (Perry 1965, 434 No. 70).

|300        The Dragon-Slayer. A youth acquires (e.g. by exchange) three won- derful dogs [B421, B312.2]. He comes to a town where people are mourning  and  learns  that  once  a  year  a  (seven-headed)  dragon [B11.2.3.1] demands a virgin as a sacrifice [B11.10, S262]. In the cur- rent year, the king’s daughter has been chosen to be sacrificed, and the king offers her as a prize to her rescuer [T68.1]. The youth goes to the appointed place. While waiting to fight with the dragon, he falls into a magic sleep [D1975], during which the princess twists a ring (ribbons) into his hair; only one of her falling tears can awaken him [D1978. 2]. Together with his dogs, the youth overcomes the dragon [B11.11, B524.1.1, R111.1.3]. He strikes off the dragon’s heads and cuts out the tongues (keeps the teeth) [H105.1]. The youth promises the princess to come back in one year (three years) and goes off. An impostor (e.g. the coachman) takes the dragon’s heads, forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933], and claims her as his reward [K1932]. The princess asks her father to delay the wed ding. Just as the princess is about to marry the impostor, the dragon-slayer returns. He sends his dogs to get some food from the king’s table and is summoned to the wedding party [H151.2]. There the dragon- slayer proves he was the rescuer by showing the dragon’s tongues (teeth) [H83, H105.1]. The impostor is condemned to death, and the dragon-slayer marries the princess. Cf. Types 301, 303, 314, 315, 502, 530, 554.

|300A       The Fight on the Bridge. (Including the previous Type 300A*.) After having eaten a (three) fish, the daughter of a tsar, her maid, and a she-dog (cow, mare, cat) give birth to sons at the same time [T511. 5.1]. (Cf. Type 303.) The three sons together go out for adventure [F601].  While his brothers are sleeping, the animal son [B631] (often a fool) fights against a three-headed dragon [B11.2.3.2] on a bridge. In the following two nights he defeats six- [B11.2.3.3], twelve- [B11.2. 3.5] or multi-headed [B11.2.3, B11.11] dragons (is able to defeat the third one only with the help of his horse [B401]). (In the form of a fly [D185.3], cat [D142] or the like,) the animal son overhears the con versations of the dragon-wives (dragon-daughters) [N451], de- feats their enchantments, and thus saves his brothers. The dragon’s mother pursues the three brothers and devours two of them [B11.10. 3]. The animal son hides in a magic forge. He outwits the dragon’s mother, who spits out the brothers she had devoured. Together with the smiths, the animal son kills the dragon’s mother, and the smiths forge her to a horse. Cf. Type 705A. In some cases, a magical old man (father of the slain dragons) defeats the animal son in a contest (horse race) and takes away his horse. The old man sends out a hero in order to win a bride (often a transition to Type 513A). In addition to this regular form, there exist two versions without the introductory part of the magic conception: (1) The dragon-slayer wins back the celestial lights which the dragon had stolen and gives them to men. (Previously Type 300A*.) Cf. Type 328A*. (2) The animal son defeats the strongest dragon and wins his horse for the tsar.

|301       The Three Stolen Princesses. (Including the previous Types 301A and 301B.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part: Introductory episodes: (1) A king banishes his three daughters to the underworld (they are abducted by monsters [H1385.1]). Three brothers (a supernatural hero with his extraordinary companions) go to find the daughters. (2) A monster (dragon, snake, etc.) steals golden apples from the king’s garden. Three brothers (princes) lie in wait. Only the youn gest is able to wound the monster. The brothers follow his bloody tracks [F102.1, N773]. (3) A child of magic birth (son of a bear or horse [B631], born from tears) grows into a youth gifted with exceptional strength [T615]. He takes to the road for adventure (luck), and allies himself with two companions with extraordinary powers [F601]. When they prepare their food, twice a little man (dwarf, devil, giant) spoils it (eats the food and beats up the cook) [F451.5.2]. Only the hero is able to catch and punish the little man, who then shows the companions the en- trance to the underworld. Main part: The companions (brothers) come to a well (pit, cave) [F92] and lower the hero (youngest brother) into it [F96]. The hero overcomes monsters (dragons, devils) and rescues (the three) princesses (with the princesses’ help, using a weapon, only by his strength, by magic means) [R111.2.1]. (The princesses give him presents.) His treach- erous companions pull the princesses up but leave the hero below [K1931.2] (cut off the rope [K963], overturn the basket). They force the maidens to name them as their rescuers [K1933]. The hero returns to the upper world with the help of a spirit, which gives him the ability to fly (a bird to whom he has to feed his own flesh [B322.1]; he ascends on a climbing plant which he himself planted, etc.). The princesses delay their wedding (for a year). On the wedding day, the hero comes to the castle and is imprisoned. But the truth comes to light (the hero is recognized by the princesses when he shows the presents [H80]), and the impostors are punished (banished, killed) [Q262]. The hero marries the youngest princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 300. In some variants, the hero has to go to much deeper regions of the underworld before he is able to come back to the upper world, because he mistakenly mounted a black animal (ram, sheep, goat, horse, lion, snake) instead of a white one. Finally the white animal carries him up again.

|301D*     The Princess’s Ring (previously Dragons Ravish Princesses). When she goes for a walk, a princess (daughter of a tsar) disappears. Her father promises her to whoever finds and rescues her [T68.1]. A sol- dier takes a ship and goes out to search for the princess. On a lonely island he meets a dragon (giant, devil), makes him drunk with wine, cuts off his head and takes away his keys [B11.11]. He finds the prin- cess and takes her to the ship. Just when they are about to sail, the princess asks for a ring she forgot, and the soldier goes back to get it. Meanwhile the ship sails away and the treacherous captain forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933]. The soldier takes service with robbers (devils, magician) and finds magic objects in a forbidden room of their house [C611] (castle) (gets them as payment). With the help of these objects he gets back home. On her wedding day with the captain, the princess recognizes the soldier by her ring [H94], tells her father the truth, and marries the soldier [L161]. Cf. Types 301, 505.

|302       The Ogre’s (Devil’s) Heart in the Egg. (Including the previous Types 302A*, 302B*, and 425P.) Because he helped some animals to divide a meal in a fair manner, a youth is rewarded with the ability to trans- form himself into their shapes (they promise their help because he spared or nourished them) [B393, B500, D1834]; cf. Type 554. He goes to rescue a princess who has been abducted by an ogre (giant, dragon, devil) (to rescue his wife who has been abducted by a supernatural enemy, cf. Type 400) [R11.1]. As an eagle, the youth comes to the ogre’s castle, as an ant into the princess’s chamber [D152.2, D182.2]. He learns from the princess that the ogre cannot be defeated because his heart (power of life, soul) is hidden outside of his body [E710]. The princess elicits the hiding place from the ogre [K975.2]: His heart lies – enclosed in various animals – in an egg (little box) [E711.1, E713]; cf. Type 590. The youth follows the princess’s instructions, finds the ogre’s soul, and destroys it (the grateful animals do so for him [B571.1]). The ogre dies [K956], and the youth marries the princess [L161]. Cf. Type 665.

|302B       Life Dependent on a Sword (previously Hero with Life Dependent on His Sword). (Including the previous Type 516B.) A childless couple magically conceive a son [T510]. An old man (his father, God) gives the son a sword (knife) which he should always carry with him (should not lay it on the ground, not pull out from its sheath). Or: The youngest of three brothers inherits a horse, clothes, and a sabre from his father, and goes out for adventure, accompanied by some companions (blood-brothers) with magic powers [F601]. With the aid of his sword he defeats the king’s army and kills a dragon(s). His companions marry the rescued women. The youth himself marries a woman of extraordinary beauty. When the king catches a sight of her picture [T11.2] or of a curl (ring, slipper) which she lost in the sea (river), he falls in love with her and sends out an old woman (witch) to capture her. By a trick the old woman enters the youth’s house, learns the se- cret of the sword [E711.10], and throws it into the sea. Deprived of his strength, the youth dies, and his wife is taken to the king. Through a life token, the youth’s friends discover what has happened, recover the sword, restore it to its original condition, and resuscitate the youth. The youth creeps into the king’s castle, hides in the room of his wife, kills the king (the old woman), and becomes king himself. Cf. Type 318.

|302C*     The Magic Horse. (Including the previous Type 422*.) At the wish of the dead king, his youngest son permits his three sisters to marry the first suitors who come for them. Visiting his brothers-in-law, he learns that they are the masters of the three kingdoms of animals. The prince wins a wife who forbids him to enter a certain room [C611]. He disregards her prohibition and revives a dragon (demon) who is impaled on a wall (contained in a hoop). The dragon frees himself and abducts the prince’s wife. The prince searches for her and three times tries to flee with her. Riding on his magic horse, the dragon overtakes the two but does not kill the prince, because he promised to spare his life three times; the fourth time, he cuts him up.

On his way to the witch, the prince wins the gratitude of three animals which help him to tend the witch’s three horses (daughters) that live in the earth, the clouds, and the sea. In payment, the prince chooses a scabby foal which turns into a magic horse (with extra legs), and he and his wife flee on his back. The magic horse is the brother of the dragon’s horse, and it compels the latter to throw off its rider, the dragon. The dragon is killed, and the prince returns home together with his wife. Cf.

|303       The Twins Or Blood-Brothers. (Including the previous Types 553 and 581.) After having eaten a magic fish (apple, water) [T511.5.1, T511.1.1, T512], a woman gives birth to twins. (Cf. Type 705A.) Grate- ful animals accompany the grown-up brothers, or animals give them one or more of their young ones because the brothers did not kill them. (The brothers are given unusual animals; they win them or bring them up; in some variants, the animals are born at the same time as the brothers [T589.7.1].) Together with his animals, one of the brothers sets out. When the brothers separate, they agree upon a life token that gives a warning when one of them is in mortal danger and needs help: Water will become cloudy, a plant or a tree dry up, a knife stuck in a tree will grow rusty, etc. [E761]. The first brother frees a princess (three prin- cesses) from a dragon (trolls), unmasks an impostor (“Red Knight”) who pretended to be the princess’s rescuer, and marries the princess [R111.1.3, K1932, H83, L161]. Cf. Type 300. Against a warning, the hero follows a light [G451] (is tempted by an animal). He falls into the power of a witch and is turned to stone [D231]. His twin brother is warned by the life token and sets forth in quest of him. The princess mistakes him for her husband, as the two brothers are very much alike [K1311.1]. At night the brother puts a naked sword in the bed between himself and his sister-in-law [T351]. Then he finds the witch, makes her remove the spell from his brother, and kills her. The first brother learns that the second has slept with his wife and kills him out of jealousy [N342.3]. Later on, when he asks his wife why she had put the sword in the bed, he realizes that his brother was innocent. The brother is resuscitated by magic means [B512] (water of life). In some variants, a youth saves the life of a raven (crane, eagle). As a reward he obtains magic objects. The youth defeats a sea mon- ster, delivers three princesses, and marries the youngest of them. (Previously Type 553.)

|303A       Brothers Seek Sisters as Wives (previously Six Brothers Seek Seven Sisters as Wives). A number of brothers (usually six, twelve or one hundred) set out to find a number of sisters as wives for themselves and their youngest brother who remained home [T69.1]. On the way an old man (giant, troll) transforms the brothers and their brides into stone and takes the youngest bride for himself [D231, R11.1].  The youngest brother goes to look for his lost brothers and comes to the old man’s house. Here he finds the youngest bride who tells him that the heart (life) of the old man is enclosed in a bird [E715.1]. With the help of grateful animals which he had fed on his way, the youngest brother catches the bird and kills it, thus killing the old man (he rescues his brothers and the brides by performing different tasks). Brothers and brides are restored to life [R155.1]. Cf. Type 302.  In some variants, the brothers marry the daughters of a witch. During the night in bed the brothers exchange their places with those of their wives. The witch kills her own daughters. Cf. Type 1119.

|304       The Dangerous Night-Watch (previously The Hunter). Together with his brothers (companions), a youth (youngest of three brothers, hunter, prince, soldier, etc.) has various hunting adventures, or he defeats dragons (wild animals, monsters) during one (three) night- watch(es) in the forest (at his father’s grave). While the youth fights, his fire (light) goes out (the youth loses his way, is tempted away by a bird). He (stops time and) meets giants (robbers, supernatural beings) whom he impresses by shooting tricks [F666.1] or by his extraordinary physical strength.      The giants go to plunder a castle (town) or to carry off a princess, and take the youth with them. The youth shoots a watchdog (rooster), enters the castle first, calls the giants and, as they enter, he cuts off their heads one at a time [K912]. Often he cuts off their tongues (heads, other parts of the body) which he takes away as trophies [H83]. Cf. Type 300. In the castle, the youth comes to a room where a princess lies sleeping [N711.2]. He looks at her (falls in love, kisses her, rapes her) and, before leaving, takes a souvenir (jewelry, handkerchief, shoes, etc.) which later becomes a token [H81.1, H81.1.1, T475.2]; cf. Types 301, 301D*. Then he returns with a burning log (lets time resume) and kindles the fire again. An impostor pretends that he had killed the giants and claims the (pregnant) princess for his wife. The princess refuses to marry him. She sets up (is made to live in) an inn [Q481] where guests need not pay anything if they tell a tale (life-history, news). (Accompanied by his brothers and mother,) the youth stops at this inn, proves his identity by means of his tale and the tokens, and marries the princess [H11.1.1, H81, L161]. The impostor is punished.

|305       The Dragon’s Heart-Blood as Remedy [D1500.1.7.3.3]. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms (cf. Types 314, 551, 673): (1) A king falls ill and learns that he can only be cured by the milk and blood of a dragon’s heart. He promises his oldest daughter to whoever is able to get the remedy, and his youngest daughter to whoever assists. A nobleman and a farmer boy set out and, with the help of an old woman, arrive at the dragon’s forest. The farmer boy kills the dragon, squeezes milk and blood out of its heart, and hides them. Threatening to kill him, the nobleman takes the dragon’s heart, presents it to the king and wins the eldest daughter and the kingdom [K1935]. The farmer boy and the youngest daughter are sent to live in the goose house. Because there were neither milk nor blood in the dragon’s heart, the nobleman, the farmer boy, and the old woman are questioned. Truth comes to light, and the kingdom goes to the farmer boy. (2) During his travels, a workman learns that the sick king can only be cured by a dragon’s liver. He sees the dragon’s vulnerable spot in a dream. He kills the dragon and boasts of his victory in an inn. The host steals the man’s knapsack which, however, contains only a stone. The workman arrives at the king’s court prior to the host, cures the king, and wins the princess as his wife. The thievish host is hanged. (3) A father orders his son to bring him the devil’s tongue to cure his illness, but the son cannot find the devil. An old man advises him to knock with a stick on a certain trunk. A horse appears and carries him to the devil. The horse gives the son a piece of his hoof which he can use to call it whenever he is in danger. The son challenges the devil, but, during the fight, the devil thrusts him into the earth up to his waist. With the help of the horse, the son defeats the devil, brings the devil’s tongue to his father, and thus cures him. (4) While hunting, a prince is bewitched and loses his voice. A young woman appears in his dream and tells him about a remedy: a medicine consisting of dragons’ eyes, a dragon’s heart and other ingredients, which must be prepared in a certain manner. In return the young woman demands that the prince marry her. After the prince agrees, a youth appears and produces the medicine in the prescribed way. The cure is successful, and the prince marries the young woman.

|306       The Danced-out Shoes. (Including the previous Type 306A.) Every day, a princess(es) wears out a pair of shoes. Her father wants to know why and offers the princess (one of the princesses) to whoever discovers the secret [H508.2]. Anyone who fails will lose his head. A youth (soldier, Gypsy, tailor, shepherd, farmer, etc.) acquires a magic object (e.g. shoes, cap, overcoat, stick) which makes him in- visible [D1980]. He refuses a narcotic drink and does not fall asleep [K625.1]. After making himself invisible, the youth accom panies the princess on a magical underground journey [D2131]. In the under- world he watches the princess wear out her shoes by dancing with the devil (dragon, other supernatural beings) [F1015. 1.1]. The next morning the youth tells the king what happened and cor roborates his tale by tokens (e.g. twigs, apples, ring, piece of the prin cess’s garment) from the underworld [H80]. He marries the princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 507. Mainly in Indian variants, a prince accompanies his wife to the otherworld where she has to dance each night before a divinity. He frees her [F87]. (Previously Type 306A.)

|307        The Princess in the Coffin (previously The Princess in the Shroud). (Including the previous Types 307B* and 307C*.) After a hasty wish (curse), a diabolic (black, mute) daughter is born to a childless couple (king and queen) [C758.1, S223]. The daughter demands that when she dies, there should be a night-watch at her coffin in the church (graveyard) (someone should watch over her for three nights in or- der to save her). The dead girl rises every night from the coffin and swallows the man on guard [E251]. A soldier (boy) learns from an old man what he must do to free the girl from the witchcraft [N825.2]. During the first two nights, he hides from the dead girl. During the third night, when the girl leaves the coffin, the soldier lies down in it, refuses to let her in, and forces her (by means of a rusty sword) to say a Paternoster (sing a hymn at the altar). As she says the prayer, the rooster crows and the girl is disenchanted [D791.1.7]. The guards are revived and the girl marries her rescuer [L162]. (The soldier tears his bride into two parts and shakes out the bad spirit in the form of reptiles.) Various other magic or religious means can be used to save the princess.

|310       The Maiden in the Tower. (Petrosinella, Rapunzel.) A (pregnant) woman steals herbs (fruits) from the garden of a witch (sorceress) [G279.2] and is forced to promise her unborn child to the witch [S222.1]. The woman bears a girl, and after a certain time the witch comes for the daughter (often called Petrosinella, Rapunzel, etc. ac- cording to the name of the stolen plant) [G204]. The witch locks her up in a tower [R41.2]. Whenever the witch wants to visit her, she enters by climbing on the girl’s long (golden) hair as on a ladder [F848.1]. A prince discovers the girl in the tower because of her hair shining in the sun [F555] and falls in love with her. The girl gives the witch a sleeping-draught. The prince climbs up on the girl’s hair and they have a love affair. The witch finds out about the nocturnal visits of the prince. She wants to prevent further visits, but accidentally discloses that the lovers could flee by transforming themselves with the help of three oak galls. The girl overhears the conversation [N455] and explains the magic  oak galls to the prince. They flee together and are pursued by the witch. They escape [D642.7] and the witch is killed. The prince mar- ries the girl [L162].

|311       Rescue by the Sister. Two sisters, one after the other, fall into power of a demonic suitor (cannibal, dragon, magician, devil) and are taken into his (subterranean) castle [R11.1, T721.5]. There the sisters open a forbidden room full of dead bodies, in the course of which the key (a magic egg, apple) becomes bloody, or they refuse to eat human flesh [C611, C227, C913]. The demon kills them for their disobedience [C920]. Using a trick, the third (youngest) sister escapes from the same fate. She finds her sisters and resuscitates them by putting their bones  together [R157.1]. She hides them beneath some gold in baskets (bags) and persuades the demon to carry the baskets home without looking into them [G561]. Cf. Type 1132. The youngest sister pretends to marry the demon and leaves a skull (straw dummy) dressed as a bride to deceive him. Unwit- tingly the demon carries this sister home in the third basket. Or she smears  herself with honey and feathers and escapes as a “strange bird” [K525, K521.1]. Cf. Types 1383, 1681. The demon is burned in his own house or is killed in another way [Q211]. Cf. Type 312.

|311B*        The Singing Bag. A Gypsy (old man) puts the niece of an old washer- woman (only daughter of an old couple) into a bag and carries her off. The Gypsy goes begging from door to door and exhibits his “singing bag”: He gives the bag a pinch, threatens to beat it with his stick, and orders it to sing. Thereupon the girl in the bag starts singing her tale: I left my rosary on a stone by the river when I was washing. When I wanted to get it, a Gypsy put me in his bag and carried me off. (I am the only daughter of an old couple. An old man carried me off when I was gathering berries in the forest.)     One day the Gypsy arrives at the old washerwoman’s house. The woman recognizes her niece, invites the Gypsy into his house, and entertains him until he gets drunk. When he is sleeping, she rescues the girl from the bag and, in her place, puts two cats (horse-dung). When the Gypsy exhibits his singing bag the next time, the cats mew. The Gypsy opens the bag and is scratched or bitten [K526].

|312D      Rescue  by  the  Brother  (previously  Brother  Saves  his  Sister  and Brothers  from the Dragon). (Pea’s Son.) A dragon (devil) carries off a girl (three girls) and kills her brothers when they try to rescue her. After a magic conception (often by swallowing a pea [T511.3]), the mother of the siblings gives birth to a strong son [F611.1]. This son kills the dragon, rescues his sister, and resuscitates his brothers. The envious brothers plan to kill the youngest. But because of his strength he is able to free himself and to punish his brothers. Cf. Type 550.

|313       The Magic Flight. (Including the previous Types 313A, 313B, 313C, and 313H*.) This type combines various introductory episodes with the two main parts of the “Magic Flight” and the “Forgotten Fian- cée”. Introductory episodes: (1) After a war between birds and quadrupeds [B261, cf. Type 222], a wounded eagle is cared for by a man. The eagle (its relatives) gives the man a box which he must not open before he arrives at home. The man disobeys and a castle appears. An giant helps the man close the box and, in return, is promised the man’s unborn son [S222]. Cf. Type 537. In some variants, a boy is promised to a demon, giant, or devil [S222,   S240], or the boy promises himself to the demon. Threat- ening him with death, the demon (giant, devil) assigns the youth (often three) impossible tasks [G465] (e.g. building a castle in one night [H1104], bailing out a pond with a sieve [H1113], felling a forest using an axe of glass, capturing a magic horse [H1154.8]) which he performs with the help of the demon’s daughter [H335.0.1]. Before the youth can marry the daughter, he must identify her in a group of women (her sisters) who look just like her. (2) A youth watches girls (transformed swans) bathing in a lake and steals the swan dress of one of them [D361.1, D721]. The girl agrees to marry the youth and takes him to her father’s house. Cf. Types 400, 465A. (3) A king suffering from leprosy (scabs) captures a prince and feeds him with sweets for forty days, in the hope that the prince’s blood will cure his sickness. The princess falls in love with the foreign youth. Main parts: Magic Flight. The daughter of the demon (king) uses her magical power to flee together with the youth. She leaves magic speaking objects (spittle, blood) behind to deceive her father [D1611]. Never- theless the flight is discovered and the father follows them. In order to escape, the girl transforms herself and her fiancé into various things or persons (e.g. into rose and thornbush, church and priest, lake and duck) [D671], or she throws magic objects (comb, brush, mirror, etc.) which become obstacles in the way of the pursuer [D672]. After the third transformation, the pursuer has to give up (dies). Cf. Type 310. In some variants of the Magic Flight two children (brother and sister) flee from a witch (demon, dragon, ogre, witch, wolf, bad step- mother). (Previously Type 313H*.) Forgotten Fiancée [D2003]. The youth goes to visit his home and leaves his bride behind. At home he breaks a taboo: Disobeying the bride’s warning, he kisses someone (eats something) and thus for- gets his experiences [D2004.2, C234, D2004.3]. When the youth is about to marry another woman, the forgotten fiancée reawakens his memory by performing magic actions (paralyses three lovers in embarrassing positions [D2006.1.1], magically stops the wedding carriage of the new bride [D2006.1.5], brings a couple of birds who remind the youth of her help [D2006.1.3], or buys a place for three nights in the bridal bed from her husband’s new bride, and in the third night successfully reawakens his memory [D1978.4, D2006. 1.4], etc.). The youth marries the true bride.

|314       Goldener (previously The Youth Transformed to a Horse). (Including the previous Type 532.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 314A, 502, and 530. Introductory episodes: (1) A boy has been promised (often in return for magic con ception) to a demon (devil, giant) [S211], or he voluntarily becomes a servant in a demon’s house [G462]. The demon orders him to care for two (groups of) animals, to feed the one and to neglect the other. The boy does not follow these instructions and thus makes friends with the abused animal (magic horse) [B316]. Against the prohibi tion of the demon, he enters a certain chamber [C611]. As a mark of disobedi- ence, his hair turns gold [C912]. The boy and the magic horse escape from the demon by a magic flight [D672]. (2) A boy (usually the son of a ruler) and a magic foal are close friends . The mother (stepmother) wants to kill the boy. The magic foal warns the boy of her secret murderous attempts. At last the mother demands that the boy or the foal be killed. The boy pre- tends to agree but asks his father to be allowed to ride the foal one last time. During this ride the foal flies away together with the boy [B184.1.6]. (3) In return for his magic conception, a boy is promised to a demon  [G461]. On the way to the demon’s house, the boy is fore- warned (given instructions for how to kill the demon or to flee). In the rooms of the demon’s house, the boy finds prisoners or corpses (and his hair turns to gold [C912]). The boy kills the demon and flees. Main part: The youth covers his golden hair, pretending to be a scaldhead, and takes service in the king’s court as a gardener [K1816.1]. (He says nothing except, “I don’t know”. [C495.1]; previously Type 532.) But the youngest princess sees him in his true form (as a golden-haired knight who destroys and restores the garden three times) [H75.4]. She falls in love with Goldener [T91.6.4] and chooses him as her husband by throwing a golden apple to him [T55.1]. They marry but the angry king banishes the couple to a shabby lodging [L132, L113.1.0.1]. The king demands the help of his sons-in-law. Goldener has only a

With the help of his magic horse he achieves various heroic deeds: He obtains the magic remedy (e.g. milk of a bird, water of life) for the king who had grown blind (cf. Type 551), kills a dragon (cf. Type 300), defeats a foreign army three times in disguise. He is wounded and is bandaged by the king. Three times he withdraws and is mocked as a fool. Cf. Type 530. Goldener’s identity is revealed (e.g. by wounds, brands) and his true status is recognized [H55, H56]. The horse asks to be de capi tated and becomes a prince (princess, other person).

|314A      The Shepherd and the Three Giants. A poor youth (orphan, fool, young est of three brothers) sets out with his only heirloom (e.g. rusty  sabre ) or with magic objects (stick, flute, etc.)which grateful old people  gave him [D817]. He becomes the king’s shepherd [L113.1.4]. Cf. Types 570, 592. The youth is allowed to pasture his livestock on the king’s land but not on the neighboring territory which belongs to three giants (because no one has ever returned from there). The youth disobeys and, with the help of his magic objects (strength), overcomes the three giants one after the other (sometimes their mother, too) [G500]. In the giants’ lodging the youth finds a magic horse [B184.1] and armour of three different metals (magic weapons, immeasurable wealth, helpful spirits, enchanted persons). The king promises his daughter to whoever rescues her from a (three) dragon(s) (cf. Type 300), wins a tournament (cf. Type 530), or helps him in battle (cf. Type 314). The youth, wearing his shining armour and riding his magic horse, succeeds three times. He with- draws and hides [R222] until the princess recognizes him as the true champion. The youth marries the princess and becomes king [L161].

|314A*     Animal as Helper in the Flight  (previously  The Bullock-savior). (Including the previous Type 314B*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A bull (horse, moose, ox, bear, wolf, birds) helps children (an- other person) to escape from their pursuer (devil, witch, robbers). (2) The devil (white wolf) wants to abduct (marry) a princess (girl). A goat puts a straw sheaf in the place of the princess, asks the real princess to climb in a cart, covers her with hay, and tells the devil whom he meets on the way that the princess is at home. The devil grabs the sheaf and takes it to hell. The goat brings the girl home. (Previously Type 314B*.) 

Combinations: 300, 313, 315, and 327.

|315       The  Faithless  Sister.  Brother  and  sister  leave  home  (are  driven out). The brother kills a number of robbers (devils, giants, dragons) but does not realize that the last one is merely wounded [F615]. The sister helps the wounded robber to recover, and he becomes her lover. In order to get rid of the brother, she pretends to be ill and sends him out to get her the milk (liver) of dangerous animals [K2212.0.2]. The brother spares the animals and they follow him (give him a whistle). After the first attempt fails, the sister binds her brother with a silk thread, or she sends him to a magic mill where the animals are kept. When the couple is about to kill the brother, he whistles for the animals. They (break out from the mill and) tear the robber to pieces. The faithless sister is imprisoned (has to repent and to fill a barrel with her tears). The brother takes to the road, rescues a princess from a dragon [R111.1.1], and marries her [L161]. Cf. Type 300. The sister is brought to the court. She tries to take revenge on her brother by putting a (poisoned) bone into his bed. The brother dies. The animals lick the bone out of his body and he revives. The sister is punished by death.

|315A      The Cannibal Sister. A woman (queen) who has only sons gives birth to a daughter. The girl first devours the animals, then her brothers and parents, and finally the inhabitants of the village (city) [G30, G346]. Only one brother escapes. (Or: At a king’s court every night someone devours horses. The elder princes who keep watch fail, but the youngest shoots the monster. He recognizes his baby sister as the cannibal because one of her fingers has been shot off. The youth is driven away [as a liar] or flees [sometimes together with his mother or elder sister].) The youth marries, gives his wife a life token, leaves his dogs (young lions, panther) behind, and returns home. He finds every- thing devastated. His sister devours his horse and threatens to devour him, too. While she is sharpening her teeth, the youth must play an instru- ment to prove he is still there. A mouse takes his place and he flees [B521]. The youth escapes and climbs three trees in succession which his sister gnaws down [R251]. Warned by the life token, his dogs come to save him and kill the cannibal sister [B524.1.2].

|316       The Nix of the Mill-Pond. A poor fisherman (miller) (unwitting- ly) promises his son [S240] to a water nix [F420.1.2], who makes the fisher man wealthy. The parents keep the child away from the water . When the appointed time comes, the son learns about his father’s promise and flees. On the way the youth divides the carcass of an animal among a lion, a falcon, and an ant (other animals) by taking the animals’ characteristics into consideration. In return he receives from the grateful animals the power to transform himself into their shapes. Using this power he wins a princess as his wife. After winning a battle (while hunting) the youth comes near the water and is seized and pulled down (swallowed) by the water nix [F420.5.2.2]. By offering precious objects (three golden apples), his wife tempts the nix to the surface. In exchange for these objects the water nix exhibits her husband: first up to his head, then up to his waist. When the water nix exhibits the husband’s whole body, he changes into a bird and escapes [R152, D642.2].

|317        The Tree That Grows up to the Sky (previously The Stretching Tree). (Including the previous Type 468.) In a king’s yard a tree grows up to the sky [F54.1]. A dragon (giant) living in the tree carries off the princess. The king promises her as a wife to whoever can bring her back. In some variants, the king promises his daughter to whoever brings him healing fruits from the tree. After noble canditates have failed, a young swineherd succeeds in climbing the tree wearing iron boots [Q502.2]. In the upper world the youth guards the dragon’s magic horse which tells him (he asks the princess to find out) where the dragon’s power is hidden. The youth kills the dragon, returns to earth together with the princess, and marries her. In some variants, in the upper world the youth watches over the magic horses of a fairy (Tündér Ilona) who gives him clothes of copper, silver, and gold. The fairy falls in love and marries the youth.

|318       The Faithless Wife. (Including the previous Type 590A.) Introduction: Two brothers live together. The younger works for the elder, who is married. The wife attempts to seduce the younger brother but he refuses her. She complains to her husband that her brother-in-law attacked her [K2111]. The youth flees from his angry brother. In some variants, this part continues as follows: The fugitive is caught and castrated. After this he lives in a foreign city. A princess falls in love with him and marries him in spite of his mutilation. When the king learns of his son-in-law’s defect, the latter has to flee. He is cured by a supernatural being and is able to return to his wife. Main part: A youth acquires magic objects, among them a magic gift (rusty sword, shirt that imparts strength) from a serpent which he rescued (by theft, by other means). Using these objects, he helps a king to be victorious and, in return, marries a princess. The princess has a lover [T232]. She persuades her husband to give her the magic objects (exchanges them) [K2213]. The husband is killed and, as he had requested, his dismembered body is loaded on his horse and carried to the serpent’s castle. The dead youth is resuscitated (by the serpent) and given the power of self-transformation. As a horse with a golden mane he is sold to the king. The princess recognizes the horse as her former husband and orders that it be killed. (On his advice) a maidservant catches drops of its blood which turn into a tree with golden apples. The princess recognizes the tree as her former husband, and orders that it be felled. (On his advice) the maidservant throws a chip into a pond, where it turns into a golden drake [D610]. The lover, leaving the sword and shirt behind, tries to catch the drake. The drake becomes a man and uses his magic power to kill his rival and his treacherous wife. He marries the maidservant.

|322*      Magnetic Mountain Draws Everything to It. A king’s ship is drawn to a magnetic mountain and smashed to pieces, and the king is washed ashore unconscious [F754]. Advised in a dream [D1814.2, F1068], the king finds a copper bow [D1091] with three lead arrows [D1092]. As instructed he climbs the mountain without looking back [C331] or speaking [C400] and shoots a copper rider off a copper horse in a temple with copper pillars. The rider falls into the sea, and the king buries the horse. The magnetic mountain begins to sink. A copper man arrives in a copper boat and rescues the king at the last mo- ment. In some variants, the rescuer is a giant bird.

|325       The Magician and His Pupil. A father apprentices his son to a magi- cian [D1711.0.1]. In order for the son to be released at the end of the apprenticeship, the father has to recognize him [H62.1, H161]. The youth secretly learns how to practice magic and flees, or his father identifies him among a flock of identical doves (other birds) with the help of tokens which the son (an old man) had given to him. The son is released. The father sells the youth successively as a greyhound, an ox, and a horse, but the son tells him not to sell the things that bind them (leash, yoke, bridle). Thus father and son become wealthy [D612, K252]. But at last the youth as a horse returns to the magi cian’s in- fluence because, contrary to instructions, the father let the magician take the bridle. So the youth loses his power and is tor mented by the magician [C837]. Finally the youth succeeds in removing the bridle. He conquers the magician in a transformation combat (they change themselves into hare, fish, bird, etc.) and escapes [D722, D615.2]. At last, trans- formed into a ring (apple, etc.), he falls into a princess’s lap. When the magician asks for the ring, the princess throws it away and grains of corn fall on the ground. The magician as a rooster is about to eat the corn, but the youth becomes a fox and bites off the rooster’s head [L142.2]. He marries the princess.

|326        The Youth Who Wanted to Learn What Fear is. A youth (fool) who does not know what fear is goes to find it [H1376.2]. He tries vari- ous frightening experiences without becoming afraid [H1400]: He is shaved by a barber-ghost [E571], spends the night under a gallows [H1415] or in a haunted castle [E281], plays with dead persons (bowl- ing [E577.3], cards [E577.2]), etc. Through his fearless behavior he disenchants a castle (wins a treasure, a promised princess) [Q82]. The youth finally learns what fear is when cold water is thrown on him [H1441], fishes are put into his bed while he is asleep [H1441.1], birds fly into his face, his cut-off head is put on backwards, etc. Sometimes sexual: he finds a woman in his bed. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other

|327A      Hansel and Gretel. A (poor) father (persuaded by the stepmother) abandons his children (a boy and a girl) in the forest [S321, S143]. Twice the children find their way back home, following scattered pebbles [R135]. On the third night, birds eat the scattered peas (bread- crumbs) [R135.1]. The children come upon a gingerbread house which belongs to a witch (ogress) [G401, F771.1.10, G412.1]. She takes them into her house. The boy is fattened [G82], while the girl must do housework. The witch asks the boy to show his finger in order to test how fat he is [G82.1], but he shows her a bone (stick) [G82.1.1]. When the witch wants to cook the boy, the sister deceives her by feigning ignorance and pushes her into the oven [G526, G512.3.2]. (The witch’s son finds out that his mother has been killed and pursues the children.) The children escape, carrying the witch’s treasure with them. Birds and beasts (angels) help them across water. They return home. Cf. Type 327.

|327B      The Brothers and the Ogre (previously The Dwarf and the Giant). Seven (three, twelve, thirty) brothers come to an ogre’s house, where they are given night lodging. The ogre intends to cut off the brothers’s heads. In order to recognize his own daughters, the ogre gives them nightcaps (head-scarves). One brother (often the youngest, Thumb            - ling) detects the plan, and all brothers put on the night caps of the ogre’s  daughters  (exchange  their  caps  for  the  daughters’  head- scarves, change sleeping-places with the daughters). In the night, the ogre cuts off his own daughters’ heads by mistake [K1611]. The brothers escape. Cf. Types 327, 1119.

|327C      The Devil (Witch) Carries the Hero Home in a Sack. A witch (ogre) entices a boy (conceived by magic, Thumbling) into her bag and carries him away (from his home). By deceiving the witch (putting stones, thorns, mud, etc. in his place), the boy is able to escape twice from the bag. The third time, the witch carries him to her home. He is to be killed by the witch’s daughter. The boy tricks the daughter (by making her show him how he should prepare to be killed [G526]), throws her into a pot (burns her in the oven), and serves her as a meal to her family [G61]. He taunts the witch, kills her, and returns home (sometimes with the witch’s treasure).

|327D      The Kiddelkaddelkar. A boy and a girl lose their way in a forest and come to the house of an ogre. The wife protects the children, but the ogre discovers them and intends to hang them. The girl persuades the ogre to show them how it is done. Hanging himself, the ogre begs to be released and promises the children his “kiddel kaddel kar”, a magic cart pulled by (golden) bucks, and much treasure. The children flee and on the way ask three men not to reveal their route. The third man is so much frightened by the ogre that he betrays the children, who hide in a cave. The ogre, not suspecting the children’s presence, lies down to sleep and blocks the way out. The children kill him but cannot leave the cave for three nights until a giant bird eats the ogre’s corpse. Then they return to their parents with the ogre’s treasure.

|327F      The Witch and the Fisher Boy. By imitating the words and voice of his mother who brings him food to the shore each day, a witch tries to catch a fisher boy. She succeeds after she has her tongue made thin by a smith [F556.2, K1832], and carries the boy to her home. When the witch’s daughter tries to bake the boy, he pushes her into the oven [G526, G512.3.2]. The boy hides in a tree and tells the witch that she has eaten her own daughter (witch finds the daughter’s  ring or hair). He is discovered. The witch fells the tree, but at the last moment birds rescue the boy (he makes wings for himself), and he flies home (the witch is trampled by animals, or she bursts while trying to drink the boy’s image reflected in the water).

|327G       The Brothers at the Witch’s House (previously The Boy at the Devil’s [Witch’s] House). A witch (devil) catches three brothers – one of them a fool – and fattens them. Her youngest daughter is to roast one of them. The fool pretends he does not know how to lie on the bread paddle and roasts the daughter, whom the old witch eats unwittingly. The same happens to the other two daughters [G512.3. 2.1]. Then the fool kills the old witch and the three brothers make their way home carrying the witch’s corpse. They climb a tree under which they see robbers. The fool drops the witch’s corpse, the robbers flee, and the  brothers take all their booty [K335.1.2.1]. Cf. Type 1653.

|328        The Boy Steals the Ogre’s Treasure. (Corvetto.) Introduction (sometimes missing): Three (twelve, thirteen, thirty, etc.) brothers arrive at the house of an ogre (devil). He would kill them in the night, but the smart young est brother saves them by exchanging their caps with those of the ogre’s daughters. (Cf. Types 327B, 1119.) The brothers take service at the king’s court. Main part: The jealous brothers claim that the youngest can steal the ogre’s treasures [H1151, H911]: magic horse [H1151.9], bedspread, carpet, parrot (lamp, sword [D1400.1.4.1], silver or golden poultry, musical instruments [D1233], etc.). Using tricks the youth gets these objects. Cf. Types 1525, 1525A. At last the brothers claim that the youngest can kidnap the ogre himself [H1172]. In disguise the youth tells the ogre that the thief died and persuades him to lie down in the coffin to measure it [G514.1]. The youth nails up the coffin, traps the ogre, and is given a princess as his wife. In some variants, the youth sets out to steal from the ogre in order to get revenge for former ill-treatment [G610.1] or to help a friendly king [G610.3]. In some variants, mainly from northern and north-western Eur- ope and the Americas, the protagonist is female.

|328A      Jack and the Beanstalk. A poor boy named Jack trades his cow for some beans (his mother finds a bean while sweeping the house). One of the beans grows into a giant beanstalk [F54.2], which Jack climbs to an upper world where he finds the house of a giant. The giant’s wife gives him food and hides him when her husband  comes home. The giant smells human flesh [G84] but his wife tells him he is mistaken [G532]. The giant eats dinner, counts his money, and then falls asleep. Jack steals the money and runs home down the beanstalk. He makes two more trips, stealing the giant’s hen that lays golden eggs [B103.2.1] and his self-playing harp [D1601.18]. The third time, the harp cries out and awakens the giant, who runs after Jack. Jack reaches the bottom of the beanstalk and chops it down. The giant falls to his death, and Jack and his mother have plenty of money. 

Remarks: The beanstalk as a ladder to the sky appears in an English tale from the  
early 18th century. The first version of the type is from 1807.

They are threatened by three giants (trolls) who share only one eye which they put by turns into their foreheads [G121.1]. The brothers steal the giants’eye [G612] and give it back in exchange for a rich reward of gold and silver (magic gifts).

The princess finds him with her magic mirror (magic book) or her perfect sight. The princess gives the youth a fourth trial: He hides behind the magic mirror (under the princess’s seat) or transforms himself (is transformed) and sits as a louse (sticks as a rose) in her hair, etc. [D641].

|330       The Smith and the Devil (previously The Smith Outwits the Devil). (Bonhomme Misère.) (Including the previous Types 330A–D and 330*.) A smith, who because of poverty (other reasons) sold his soul to the devil (death) [M211], gives shelter to Christ and St. Peter during their visit on earth [K1811]. In reward, three of his wishes shall be fulfilled [Q115] (cf. Type 750A). St. Peter warns him to wish for a place in paradise, but the smith wants a tree and a bench (chair) to which people stick and a knapsack that draws people into it [J2071, D1413.1, D1413.5, D1412.1] (a pack of cards with which he shall al- ways win [N221], etc.). Cf. Type 753A. When the devil (death) is about to carry the smith away, he sticks to the bench and the tree and has to give the smith more time to live (terminate the contract), or no one would be able to die [Z111.2]. At last the devil is put into the sack and beaten up (on the anvil) [K213]. The smith, tired of life, cannot go either to heaven or to hell [Q565]. He tricks St. Peter by pushing his knapsack into heaven, where it pulls him in [K2371.1.3] (throws his cards inside the gate of heaven and is permitted inside to pick them up). In some variants the trickster-protagonist is an allegorical figure (e.g. Misery, Envy, Poverty) who traps the devil in a tree until the devil promises him immortality. Then he sets the devil free. (Pre- viously Type 330D.)

|331       The Spirit in the Bottle. A man (son of a woodcutter, smith, fisher- man, soldier) frees an evil spirit from a vessel (bottle) out of curios- ity (because he was asked by the spirit) [R181]. The spirit (which stretches  out to an enormous height,) wants to take revenge for being locked for so long, and threatens to kill his rescuer. The man tricks the spirit: He pretends he does not believe that the spirit could grow small again and thus induces him to go back into the vessel [K717]. The man stoppers the bottle and the spirit is trapped. In some variants, he is released again in return for a gift (wonder- ful remedy, magic power [D1240, D2102]). Cf. Types 155, 735A.

|332       Godfather Death. (Including the previous Types 332A* and 332B*.) A poor man with many children wants a (just) godfather for his new- born son. He refuses God (saint, devil) and chooses death (angel of death, plague) because he treats everyone alike [Z111, J486]. As a gift the father (son) receives the magic power of forecasting recovery or death, depending on whether death stands at the head or the foot of the sick person’s bed [D1825.3.1]. Thus the man becomes a fam ous doctor and grows wealthy. The doctor betrays death (several times): When promised wealth (the princess), the doctor turns the bed and thus saves the life of a person who was supposed to die [K557] (in the doctor’s dying hour, death grants him time to say a last Paternoster, but the doctor does not finish the prayer [K551.1] – cf. Type 1199. Death tricks the doctor into finishing the prayer.) In some variants, death shows the man his life-light in the under- world and suddenly extinguishes it [E765.1.3, K551.9]. Or the man attempts to lengthen his life by various means (usually without suc- cess). (Previously Type 332A*.) Cf. Type 1187. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 1199, and also 326, 330, 331, 334, 1164, and 1187.

|332C*     Immortality Won through Betrayal of Death. This tale exists in two different forms: (1) An old soldier becomes the doorkeeper for heaven. Death asks him several times whom he should take next. God wants death to take the old people (then people in the middle of their life, then young people in succession). However, the doorkeeper wants to save his parents (wife, children), so he tells death instead to fell firs (beech- trees, oaks). God discovers this deception and shows death whom he should take next. Thus the soldier and his relatives are reunited in heaven. (In some variants, the soldier is banished to hell. Here he delivers a number of souls from purgatory and is chased away. Cf. Type 475.) (2) A prince wants to gain immortality. He travels through three different kingdoms, in which the rulers have to perform tasks which must be finished within 600 (800, 1000) years (pulling out a tree, carrying off a mountain, wearing out thousands of sewing needles). During this time death has lost his power. Each time the prince is given magic objects and asked to stay, but he travels on. Finally he arrives at the empire of immortality. After a thousand years he goes to look for his parents. The queen of immortality gives him water of life which he uses to resuscitate the deceased rulers of the three kingdoms. The prince, finding no trace of his former home and family, returns. Pursued by death, he reaches the border of the empire of immortality. In a contest with death, the queen of immortality wins the prince and they live to- gether forever.

|333       Little Red Riding Hood (previously The Glutton). (Petit Chaperon Rouge, Cappuccetto rosso, Rotkäppchen.) (Including the previous Type 333A.) A little girl, called “Red Riding Hood” because of her red cap, is sent to her grandmother who lives in the forest and is warned not to leave the path [J21.5]. On the way she meets a wolf. The wolf learns where the girl is going, hurries on ahead, and devours the grandmother (puts her blood in a glass and her flesh in a pot). He puts on her clothes and lies down in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother’s house. (She has to drink the blood, eat the flesh, and lie down in the bed.) Red Riding Hood doubts whether the wolf is her grandmother and asks him about his odd big ears [Z18.1], eyes, hands, and mouth. Finally the wolf eats Red Riding Hood [K2011]. A hunter kills the wolf and cuts open his belly. Red Riding Hood and the grandmother are rescued alive [F913]. They fill the wolf’s belly with stones [Q426]; he is drowned or falls to his death. Cf. Types 123, 2028. In some variants Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother’s house before the wolf. The wolf climbs on the roof to wait until Red Riding Hood leaves. The Grandmother who had boiled sausages asks Red Riding Hood to fill the broth into a big trough in front of the house. Enticed by the smell, the wolf falls from the roof and is drowned in the trough.

The lender, an ogre (witch, wolf), asks the girl to bring back some cakes and wine. On her way she eats the cakes, drinks the wine, and replaces them with horse-dung and urine. Angry about the trick, the ogre pursues the girl home and devours her (is not able to get into the house, is tricked out by the girl’s mother). (Previously Type 333A.)

|361       Bear-Skin. A poor soldier sells his soul to the devil for an immense amount of money (a purse which will never be empty) [M211]. The soldier’s soul will be released after he has lived for seven years wit- hout washing or combing himself [C721.1, C723.1]. The soldier helps a poor man, who agrees to let him marry one of his daughters. The two elder daughters scoff at the dirty man, but the youngest daughter agrees to marry him [L54.1]. The soldier leaves her a token (half of a ring or coin). After seven years the bargain is completed. The devil washes and dresses the soldier, and releases him. He returns to his bride as a rich gentleman and is recognized by the token. The envious elder sisters commit suicide. Thus instead of one soul the devil gets two (sometimes more) [K217]. Cf. Type 475.

|365        The Dead Bridegroom Carries off His Bride. (Lenore.) (Including the previous Type 365A*.) A young woman mourns for her bridegroom who did not return from war (brings him back to life by magic). One night he appears, invites her to ride with him, and carries her behind on his horse. Two times he asks her whether she is afraid. She says no because her lover is with her. The third time they arrive at a graveyard. When the bridegroom wants to entice her into an open grave, she realizes that he is dead. He grasps at her and tears her clothing. The bride escapes (is pulled into the grave [E215], danced to death by the dancing dead, or torn to pieces).

|366       The Man from the Gallows. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man (woman, child) takes the liver (lung, heart, stomach, backside) of a corpse who has been hanged (other dead person). At home the meat is eaten (often without knowing what it is [G60]). At night the dead person appears, asks for the stolen part of his body, and punishes the perpetrator (eater) by carrying him away (to hell) or by killing him [E235.4]. (2) A child (adult person) who has lost a leg (arm) wears a gold- en (diamond) one as a substitute. The child dies, and the parents (ser vants, grave-diggers, etc.) take the golden leg. At night the dead child appears, complains about the loss of his leg [E235.4.1, E235. 4.2], and receives it back.

|369       The Youth on a Quest for His Lost Father. A boy (young man) sets out to find his father who went away (disappeared) before his birth [H1381.2.2.1]. He comes to the house of an old woman (witch) and tricks her (kills her, wins a contest with her son). He finds his father (alive, dead, or transformed into an animal). The boy (a god) re leases (resuscitates) his father.

|400       The Man on a Quest for His Lost Wife. (Including the previous Types  400*, 401, and 401A.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A man in distress (impoverished fisherman, merchant) un- wittingly promises his (unborn) son to the devil [S240]. When the boy is delivered to him later, the devil cannot use him because he is protected by magic [K218.2] (cf. Type 810). Thus the boy is cast out in the sea (river, desert). He arrives in a foreign country and finds a lonely castle where he meets a bewitched princess (maiden, fairy) in the form of a serpent (deer). He rescues her by enduring three nights of torture [D758.1]. They marry [F302, L161]. When he wants to visit his parents, his wife gives him a ring to carry him home [D1470.1.15], and she forbids him to call her to come to him [C31.6] (to boast of her beauty [C31.5]). At home he is in duced (by his mother) to break the taboo. His wife appears [D2074. 2.3.1], takes the ring, and leaves him destitute. The man sets out in search of his wife [H1385.3]. On his way he meets three hermits (rulers of animal kingdoms, or moon, sun, and wind) whom he asks for directions [B221, H1232, H1235]. With the help of the third he arrives at the empire of his wife, or he pretends that he wants to help three giants who are fighting over magic ob- jects (inheritance, booty). He steals the magic objects (magic sword [D1400.1.4],  magic  coat  or  hood  [D1361.14],  seven-league  boots [D1521.1]) [D831, D832] (cf. Type 518). With their help he is able to overcome the obstacles on the way to his wife [D2121]. When he finds his wife, she is about to marry another man [N681]. He discloses his identity as her real husband. (2) Meeting the princess and disenchantment as in version (1); but the disenchantment is not complete. The princess wants to travel back to her own distant land. She asks her rescuer to wait for her at a certain time and place. She ap- pears three times, but each time a servant (witch) has put her hus- band into a deep sleep from which he cannot be awakened [D1364.15, D1364.4.1, D1972]. The princess informs him (in a letter) how and where to find her (on the glass mountain). The man sets out to find her. Continued as in version (1). (3) A youth watches a flock of birds (swans, ducks, geese, doves) land on the shore. The birds take off their feather coats and become beautiful maidens [D361.1]. While they are bathing, the youth steals the feather coat of the most beautiful girl, who cannot leave with the others and thus must marry the youth [D721.2, B652.1]. Later, be- cause of carelessness (of the man’s mother), the maiden takes back her coat [D361.1.1] and flies away (together with her children). She tells the youth her destination in the otherworld (e.g. glass moun- tain). The man sets out in search of his wife (as in version 1). Some variants include elements from Type 313 (Magic Flight).

|401A*        The Soldiers in the Enchanted Castle. Miscellaneous type. Twelve (seven, three) soldiers (deserters) come (often with the help of an  animal or person) to a lonely castle (small house), where they receive food and lodging. A white woman (maiden who appears in a dream) asks them to stay in the castle for seven years (one year and two days) (to keep guard for three nights) and to fulfill certain conditions (not to think of a maiden, not to touch or look at the maidens who sleep in their beds, not to open a certain door). They disobey the prohibition and flee, or all (but one) leave the castle before the end of the vigil. Thus their efforts to disenchant the princesses who live in the castle are unsuccessful [D759.9]. The soldiers often return later, and the one is rewarded (often after having performed different tasks), but the others are killed.    In some variants the soldiers succeed in disenchanting the prin- cesses and each of them marries one of them (seven seven-year-old boys finally break the spell) [D759.10].

|402          The Animal Bride (previously The Mouse [Cat, Frog, etc.] as Bride). A father is not able to decide which of his (three) sons should inher- it his property (kingdom) and sends them all on a quest for one year [H1210.1]. They are told to bring back a special object (yarn, linen [H1306], fine chain [H1303], ring, horse, smallest dog [H1307], money ) or they must learn a profession. Whoever performs the task best will be the heir.    The youngest son, often a fool, goes into a forest and becomes the servant of an animal (cat [B422], rat, frog [B493.1], mouse [B437.2]). As a payment he is given the object that his father had asked for. It proves to be the most beautiful one, and thus he should be the heir [H1242]. Because his brothers (parents) are envious, two further tasks are set, and finally the brothers are required to bring a bride (most beautiful woman [H1301.1]).

The animal is disenchanted by burning, mutilation, decapi- tation [D711], or by crossing a river [B313, D700], and becomes a beautiful princess with a castle. They return happily to his parents as bride and bridegroom. Sometimes they deceive the parents: The youngest son arrives dressed in rags and is ridiculed; then the bride arrives and they reveal their identities. When the son arrives in the first place dressed as a prince, a mole helps to identify him. Often the youngest son renounces his inheritance and goes with his wife back to her castle. In some variants from eastern and southeastern Europe and the Near East, the youngest son takes the animal (often a frog or toad) to his home and hides it from the family. The father assigns tasks to his daughters-in-law which the frog performs best. The last (third) task requires the brides to attend a feast, where the frog turns into the most beautiful woman. The bridegroom burns the frog’s skin so that the bride cannot change back. As a consequence she leaves him, and he sets out on a quest and finally is able to retrieve her. Cf. Type 400.

|403       The Black and the White Bride. (Including the previous Types 403A and 403B.) A stepmother hates her stepchildren [S31]. The step- daughter is kind to someone she meets (e.g. Christ and St. Peter) (she is sent after strawberries in winter [H1023.3], and meets dwarfs who help her). In return she is given great beauty [D1860] (the power of dropping gold or jewels from her mouth [D1454.2, D1454. 1.2]). The stepmother’s own daughter is unkind under these condi tions and is made ugly [D1870] (made to drop toads from her mouth [M431.2]) [Q2]. The stepdaughter’s brother is in service at the court of a king. He takes his sister’s picture with him. The king sees the girl’s picture, falls in love with her, and sends the brother for her [T11.2]. (The beautiful stepdaughter is seen accidentally by a king or prince, who marries her [N711, L162].)

The king marries the ugly stepsister [K1911], and the brother is thrown into prison or a pit of snakes [Q465.1]. (The king’s wife gives birth to a child. The stepmother throws her and her child into the water and substitutes her own daughter for the bride [K1911.1.2].) The true bride is transformed to a duck (goose) [D161.2], and comes to the king’s court three times (to care for her child [D688]). The last night the king wakes and disenchants her by decapitation [D711] (cutting her golden belt, holding her during successive trans- formations [D712.4]). The brother, unharmed in the den of snakes [B848], is rescued. The true bride is married or reinstated, and the false bride and her mother are punished [Q261]. Cf. Types 450, 480, 510B, 511.

|404       The Blinded Bride. (Previously Type 533* and part of Type 533.) A  girl  is  blessed  at  birth  by  fairies  (is  kind  to  a  snake)  who cause  her to produce gold (jewels, flowers) from her hands (mouth [D1454.2], footsteps [D1454.7], tears [D1454.4]). A king sees the girl and wants to marry her. Her wicked stepmother (aunt) and step sister accompany her on the journey to the king’s court. On the way, the girl’s stepmother feeds her with salty food. When the girl asks for water, the stepmother puts out both of her eyes [S165] or muti lates

A kind fisherman (poor man) finds the blinded girl, takes her home, and becomes rich from the gold from her hands. He uses the gold (jewels, flowers) to buy back the girl’s eyes [E781.2] (the snake commands this). The girl recovers her sight, dresses in beau- tiful clothes, and goes to the king’s court. The king recognizes her when she washes her hands. He marries her, and the wicked women are burned. (The snake is the girl’s guardian angel and returns to heaven .)

|407       The Girl as Flower. (Including the previous Types 407A, 407B, 652A, and 702B*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A girl (woman, fairy) has been transformed into a flower (twig, bush, tree, fruit) (transforms herself) [D212]. A man (her pre destined lover) breaks a stalk and the flower changes back into a girl [D711.4] (he takes the girl in the form of a flower on a journey with him and transforms it afterwards). He marries her [T101] (some times her ve- getable clothing has to be burned). Cf. Type 652. (2) After a hasty wish, a woman gives birth to a twig (bush, fruit) [T513, T555], plants it in a pot, and cares for it as for a child. A prince is irresistibly drawn to the plant and becomes love-sick [T24.1]. He obtains the plant. During the night a girl comes out of it, eats, and makes love with him. When the prince has to go to war, the girl stays in the plant. The prince attaches a bell to the plant which he will ring when he wants to call the girl. An envious woman (fiancée) signals the girl to come. She ap pears and is killed, and her plant is destroyed. A compassionate woman resuscitates the girl [E0], and the rival is punished. (Pre viously Types 407A and 652A. Because of its structural similarity, also the previous Type 702B* is integrated here.) (3) A beautiful girl wants to have a lover, even if he is the devil (a dead man) [C15]. The devil comes in the form of an attractive man (with animal feet). She follows him and sees him eating corpses in a church [G20.1]. Several times she is asked whether she had seen anything. She denies this repeatedly, even when the devil kills her sister, mother, and father. At last she herself dies. Because she had made special arrangements for her funeral, the devil cannot find her. Cf. Types 363, 1476B. From her grave grows a beautiful flower (lily, rose, tulip) [E631.1] which only her predestined husband (nobleman, prince) is able to pick. Because she has to eat, at night she becomes a beautiful woman.

The couple succeeds in tricking or killing the devil (the devil takes the woman to hell). (Previously Type 407B.)

|408       The Three Oranges. A prince insolently breaks an old woman’s jar (makes her angry in another way). She utters a curse: he is to fall in love with three oranges (lemons, other fruits, girls of magic origin) [S375]. The prince sets out on a (sometimes very long) quest during which he is given directions, advice, and help to overcome obstacles. The prince finds the fruits in a garden (castle). When he opens them, out of each comes a beautiful, often naked, young woman who asks for water (comb, mirror, towel, clothes, etc.) [D721.5]. The prince can give only the third woman what she asks for, and the other girls die (disappear, return into the fruits). The prince hides the woman on a tree besides a fountain while he goes to get clothes (carriage, company) for her. An ugly black woman (Gypsy woman, witch) comes to get water. She thinks that the reflection of the Orange Girl is her own [J1791.6.1], and breaks her water jar because she thinks she is too beautiful to carry water. The Orange Girl laughs, and the black woman discovers her. The black woman succeeds in taking the Orange Girl’s place (two different versions). The prince returns, and though he is aston ish ed at the sudden change (excuses: sunburn, influences of wind and weather), he marries the false bride. (1) The black woman pushes the Orange Girl into the water [K1911.2.2], where she changes into a fish [D170] (bird [D150]). The false bride demands that it be killed, but from its remains grows a tree. She demands it be felled, but an old woman (man) takes away a splinter (log) [D610]. Out of this once again comes the Orange Girl, who secretly does the old woman’s housework. The old woman finds the girl and adopts her. The prince recognizes her when he hears her life history (when the girl tends one of his horses) [K1911.3]. (2) The black woman combs (louses) the Orange Girl and sticks a magic needle into her head. The girl changes into a dove [D150] and flies to the castle. The gardener (cook) hears the bird’s song ask- ing about the prince and his black wife. The dove is captured and the prince is much pleased with it. He finds the magic needle and removes it, and thus the dove changes back into the Orange Girl [K1911.3]. Cf. Type 452B*. After the couple’s reunion, the false bride is punished (sentenced to a cruel death; she often pronounces her own judgment).

|409       The Girl as Wolf. An evil stepmother substitutes her own daughter for her married stepdaughter and transforms the stepdaughter into a wolf (lynx, fox) [D113.1], which hides in the forest. Every day the wolf comes, throws off her animal skin, and suckles her child (the child is brought to the forest). The child’s father observes this, recognizes his beloved wife and (on the advice of a magician) burns her animal skin. Thus she is restored to human form [D721.3]. The stepmother and her daughter are executed [Q261]. Cf. Type 403.

|409A      The Girl as Goat. (Including the previous Types 413A* and 413B*.) A childless woman wants a child even if it is only an animal. She bears a girl with an animal form (goat, jackdaw, pig, fish, etc.) [T554]. (An old woman finds a magic pumpkin which, at night, turns into a beautiful woman who cleans her house.) A youth (prince) observes the girl when she (while washing clothes, etc.) has removed her animal skin. He proposes to her and marries her [T111]. His mother disapproves of the marriage and torments the girl (who often plays a trick on her). Three times the girl appears at a festival in her human form, is admired, and dances. Twice she escapes and assumes her goat form. The third time the youth destroys the goat covering and disenchants the girl. Cf. Type 510A. In some variants, another young man decides to get married in the same way. But he is disappointed: his wife, a little pig, never changes into a girl.

|410       Sleeping Beauty. (Dornröschen, La bella addormentata.) (An nounced by a frog [B211.7.1, B493.1]) a daughter is born to a royal couple. A fairy (wise woman) who has not been invited to the celebration (baptism) utters a curse that the princess (on her 15th birthday) will die of a wound from a spindle (needle, fiber of flax) [F361.1.1, F316, G269.4, M341.2.13]. Another fairy changes the death sentence into a long (hundred-year) sleep [F316.1]. The king orders that every spindle (needle) in his empire be destroyed;  but,  because  one  of  them  has  been  overlooked,  the prophecy is fulfilled [M370]: The girl meets an old woman who is spinning in a hidden chamber, pricks her finger with the spindle, and sinks, together with the whole court, into a magic sleep [D1364. 17, D1960.3, F771.4.4, F771.4.7]. Around the castle grows a hedge of thorns [D1967.1] (the girl is enclosed in a tower). At the end of the appointed time, a youth (prince) breaks through the hedge [N711.2] and awakens the princess with a kiss [D735, D1978.5] (he impregnates her; she gives birth to two children, one of whom sucks the fiber out of her finger and thus disenchants her). In some variants the prince takes his wife and children to his family. During his absence the evil mother-in-law asks the cook to slaughter and roast the woman and the children. The cook disobeys, and the mother-in-law demands that the three be thrown into a tub full of poisonous toads and snakes. Unexpectedly the prince returns home, and the mother-in-law herself jumps into the tub.

|425A      The Animal as Bridegroom. (Including the previous Type 425G.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 430, 432, and 441. Introductory episodes: (1) The youngest daughter asks her father (the king) to bring her a (musical) rose (lark, etc.) from his journey. He finds it in the garden of a beast, but in return has to promise his daughter (the first being he meets when he arrives at home) [L221, S228, S241] to the beast. The father tries in vain to send another girl instead of his daughter [S252]. Cf. Type 425C. (2) An animal-son (snake, crayfish, also pumpkin, etc.) is born (because of the hasty wish of his parents) [C758.1]. He demands a princess for his wife and performs difficult (impossible) tasks. The princess has to marry him [T111]. (3) A girl is intended (by fate) for an animal bridegroom or agrees to marry him [B620.1, L54.1]. (4) For other reasons a girl has an animal husband and lives to- gether with him in his castle. He becomes a beautiful man by night [D621.1, B640.1]. Main part: When the young wife (often on the advice of her female rela- tives) burns the animal-skin of her bridegroom [C757.1] (looks at him during the night or burns him with candle wax [C32.1, C916.1],  

FFC 284                              Tales of Magic                                  249 reveals his secret [C421], or otherwise prevents his disenchantment), he goes away [C932]. The young wife sets out for a long and difficult quest [H1385.4] (in iron shoes [Q502.2], etc.). On her way she is given directions and precious gifts by the sun, moon, wind, and stars [H1232] (helpful old people or animals [H1233.1.1, H1235). She arrives (sometimes by climb ing a glass mountain [H1114]) at her bridegroom’s far-away residence. She finds that her husband has another (supernatural) bride. She takes service as maid [Q482.1] and trades her precious things (golden implements for spinning, jewels, magnificent clothes, etc.) for three nights by the side of her lost husband [D2006.1.1]. She wants to awaken his memory of her, but two times he is drugged by a sopor ific. He spills the soporific on the third night, stays awake, and recognizes her as his true bride [D2006.1.4]. (Death of the false bride.) Cf. Type 313. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 300, 301, 313, 402, 425, 425B, 425C, 425E, 432, 433B, and 441. 
Remarks: Many structural similarities between Types 425A and 425B. Partly be- 
cause Swahn reversed subtypes A and B, some variants are not clearly assigned  
to one type or the other. Essential for Type 425A are the motifs “wife’s quest and  
gifts” and “nights bought”.

|425B     Son of the Witch (previously The Disenchanted Husband: the Witch’s Tasks). (Cupid and Psyche.) (Including the previous Types 425J, 425N, and 428.) This type combines various introductory epi sodes with a common main part. Cf. Type 425A. Introductory episodes: A young woman marries a supernatural bridegroom: (1) She is given to her bridegroom because of a present that she has asked her father to bring back from a journey [S228]. (2) The bridegroom performs a set of difficult tasks. (3) She pulls up an herb and discovers the bridegroom’s subter- ra nean castle (a wind carries her there). (4) She finds him in another way. The bridegroom is the son of a witch (ogress) or he is (during the day) an animal [D621.1]. Main part: The young woman breaks the bridegroom‘s prohibition (cf. Type 425A), and he goes away [C932]. (Before he leaves, he gives her a token, e.g. ring, feather.) (In iron shoes) she sets out to find him [H1385.4, H1125]. The bride comes to the house of her bridegroom’s mother, a witch, who swears by her son’s name not to devour her. The witch imposes difficult tasks on the young woman, which she performs (with the help of her bridegroom): to sort a large quantity of grain [H1122], to fill mattresses with the feathers of all kinds of birds, to wash the black wool white and the white black [H1023.6, cf. Type 1183], to sweep a house but leave it unswept [H1066], etc. In some variants she enchants (three) suitors and makes them fight (part of previous Type 425N). Cf. Types 313, 875. The young woman is sent on a dangerous journey to bring a casket from the sister of the witch. Having passed obstacles (with the advice from her bridegroom) and obtained the casket, she is for- bidden to open it. (Cf. Types 408, 480.) When the bride acts against the prohibition, her husband helps her. At the wedding of the bridegroom and the witch’s daughter, the young woman has to hold ten burning candles (torches). Her bride- groom saves her from being burned. 

FFC 284                              Tales of Magic                                 251 The young woman remarries her bridegroom, or both escape by a magic (transformation) flight [D671, D672]. In some variants a female demon (witch) demands that a young woman accomplish impossible tasks [G204, H1010, H931]. Among other things, the girl has to bring a letter to another demon telling her to kill the girl [K978] (cf. Type 930). A wolf helps the girl to es cape the danger [B435.3]. As a reward, the wolf is disenchanted. He turns to a prince [D113.1] and marries the young woman. (Pre viously Type 428.) 

Combinations: 425A, 425C, 425E, 433B, and 857. 
Remarks: The earliest literary version is by Apuleius, Cupid and Psyche, in Meta- 
morphoses (IV,28–VI,24), ca. 100 C.E. Many structural similarities exist between  
Types 425A and 425B, and often the variants are not clearly identified as belong ing  
to one type or the other. The essential feature of this type is the quest for the cas- 
ket, which entails the visit to the second witch’s house. Usually the super natural  
bridegroom is the witch’s son, and he helps his wife perform the tasks. According  
to Swahn (1955), the previous Type 428 is a fragment of Type 425B.

|425C      Beauty and the Beast. (Including the previous Type 425H.)  A mer- chant sets out on a journey and intends to bring back pres ents for his three daughters. The two elder ones demand jewels and clothes,  the youngest a rose [L221]. The father is not able to find one. He loses his way and stays overnight in a deserted castle, where he breaks off a rose. An (invisible) animal (beast) demands that the man return or send a substitute [S222]. The youngest daughter meets her father’s obligation but refuses to marry the (ugly) animal, who treats her kindly. In a magic mirror she sees her father is ill. She is allowed to visit him but (influenced by her envious sisters) overstays the allotted time [C761.2]. She returns and finds the animal near death, realizes she loves him, and caresses or kisses him. By this means she dis- enchants the prince from his animal shape [D735.1]. They marry. 

Combinations: 300, 425, and 425A. 
Remarks: Type 425C is characterized by the “presents for the daughters” intro- 
duction and the absence of a quest or search. It first appears in two 18th cen- 
tury French versions, Mme. de Villeneuve’s La Belle et la bête (1740) and Mme. de  
Beaumont’s tale of the same name (1757). Cf. Mme. d’Aulnoy, Le Mouton (1698).

|425D      The Vanished Husband (previously Vanished Husband Learned of by Keeping Inn [Bath-house]). (Including the previous Type 425F.) (A childless couple adopts an animal or object which grows up and wants to marry; cf. Type 433B). The animal (crayfish, frog, he-goat, bird, etc., or the head of a donkey) performs the tasks set for the suitors [T68] and marries the king’s youngest daughter. During the night he turns into a beautiful young man [B640.1]. He warns his wife against telling his secret, but she breaks the taboo and he leaves her [C932]. The wife sets up an inn (bakery, bathhouse) where everyone who tells a tale gets free service [H11.1.1] (disguised as a man [K1837], she gives a golden coin to everyone she meets, if they will tell a tale). She thus learns where her husband lives and how to save him [C991]. She finds her husband and disenchants him. In some variants a princess loses her enchanted bridegroom, a bird [D150], and becomes melancholy. The king promises a reward to anyone who can make the princess laugh [H1194]. An old woman,  who knows where the bridegroom lives, tells the princess and makes her laugh. The princess finds her bridegroom in his castle. She re- leases him from his enchantment by starving for seven years (stand- ing without shelter out in the wind and rain for a year or more). By doing this she becomes so ugly that the prince does not want her. With the help of kind fairies she becomes beautiful and wealthy. Her bridegroom falls in love with her. She makes demands on him (he must build a bridge and lie down in a coffin). They are reunited. (Previously Type 425F.)

|425E      The Enchanted Husband Sings Lullaby. (Including the previous Type 425L.) A young woman follows an enchanted man (usually a prince) to his underground castle (grotto) and marries him. During the night her husband takes on his human shape. He forbids her to open a certain room [C611] (she is not allowed to watch him at night, to wake him up, to open the padlock of his heart or to look through a keyhole into his body). She breaks the taboo and, although she is pregnant, she is chased away. The pregnant woman finds lodging in the house of a rich woman (queen) whose son had disappeared a long time ago. Here she gives birth to a child. At night the enchanted husband visits his sleeping wife, sings a lullaby to the child, and thus tells how he may be dis- enchanted (roosters must not crow, church bells must not ring, etc.). Maidservants report this to the lady of the house. In the third night the conditions demanded in the song are met (the enchanted man is embraced or seized). The man is released from the enchant ment and is recognized as the missing son. (Previously Type 425L.) Cf. Type 434.

|425M      The Snake as Bridegroom (previously Bathing Girl’s Garments Kept). A serpent (water being, dragon) steals the clothes of a bathing girl and gives them back only when she promises to marry him [K1335]. The serpent takes her as his bride to his splendid castle (at the bottom of the sea) where she gives birth to two children. The serpent promises that the woman may visit her parents if she performs certain impossible tasks (wearing out iron shoes [H1125, Q502.2], spinning an endless thread, etc.) [H1010]. By fol low ing the advice of an old woman she succeeds [N825.3], and finally she and her children are allowed to visit her parents for three days. But she is warned not to tell anyone about her husband [C421]. The woman keeps the promise. The children, however, tell the relatives about their father and give away the secret of the magic formula by which he can be summoned. The woman’s brothers call the serpent and kill him. Together with her children the woman returns. She calls her husband, but there is only blood in the sea. So she realises that the children have betrayed her and condemns them to be turned into trees [D215].

|425*      The Insulted Bridegroom Disenchanted (previously Enchanted Ani- mal Husband Insulted by Guests). A princess (the youngest of three sisters) wants to marry. Her father insists that she must marry the first one whom she meets (whoever picks up a certain rose). A mouse with a stinking tail (a poor man carrying water) comes by, and the princess marries him [T118]. During the wedding feast, when guests insult the mouse-bridegroom, the castle and all its inhabitants disap- pear, and the princess finds herself alone. She sets out on a quest for her lost husband [H1385.4]. Two her- mits direct her to the underworld. There she finds the castle of the mouse-bridegroom. Through her love he is disenchanted and turns into a beautiful prince [D700].    In some variants the princess lives in poverty with her husband. She dreams of a splendid castle and of wealth. Two times the dream comes true, and she invites her relatives to the castle. When her poor husband appears, someone calls his name and the castle disappears. The third time, she instructs them not to call her husband’s name. Thus he is disenchanted.

|426          The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf. During the winter two sisters (called “Snow White” and “Rose Red”) invite a bear into their hut. Three times the sisters rescue an evil dwarf who was going to steal some treasures, but he is ungrateful and insults them [F451.2. 3.1, K1111.1, F451.6.1, F451.5.2.1].    Thereupon the bear (who had been enchanted by the dwarf) catches  him. The dwarf offers treasures to the bear if he will devour the girls instead of him. But the bear kills the dwarf and thus is dis- enchanted and turns into a prince [D763]. The prince marries one of the sisters and his brother (who was not mentioned until then) the other.

|430          The Donkey. (Asinarius.) After a royal couple have long wished for children, the queen finally gives birth to a donkey. Raised as a human, he learns courtly customs and how to sing and play the lyre  (harp, etc.) [D963].    On the day when he first sees a reflection of his face, he runs away accompanied by a servant. In a foreign country he entertains the king’s court with his musical talents. He meets the king’s daughter and is charmed by her beauty.

On the wed- ding night the donkey takes off his skin and turns into a hand some prince. A servant who observes this tells the king, who burns up the skin on the following night [D721.3]. The prince, unable to become a donkey again, wants to flee, but the king stops him and gives him part of his kingdom. Cf. Type 425A. 

Remarks: From a versified novella from southern Germany of ca. 1200, which was  
much read in courtly circles. The donkey with human sensibilities is traced to the  
ancient novelle of Pseudo-Lucian and Apuleius. Prose versions were popu larized  
by the Grimms’ text. Oral versions are often so much abbreviated that they are  
difficult to distinguish from Type 425A.

|431       The House in the Forest. Three sisters one after the other go to a house in the forest where an old man lives with his three animals [D1890, D166.1.1, D166.1, D133.1]. The two older girls cook and make a bed only for the man, not for the animals, nor do they wait for the old man to go to bed before they do [Q2]. He shuts them up in his cellar. The youngest girl takes care of the animals, feeds them [L54] and takes the leftovers for herself, and goes to bed only after the old man is settled down for the night. She wakes up in a palace. Instead of the old man, she finds a young prince, who, together with his three servants, had been enchanted by a witch. The girl and the prince marry [L162], and the sisters must serve as maids until they prove themselves to be sympathetic to animals. In some variants a woman spoils her lazy, bad-tempered daugh- ter and mistreats the industrious stepsister, giving her only a little food. She follows a rolling loaf of bread to a (enchanted) house in the forest. She shares her food with animals who live there (whom she has brought with her) and is kind to an old man or an animal-man (forest spirit). On the advice of the animals, she takes the man to bed with her, and he is disenchanted (along with the animals) [D731]. She marries the man or is given a reward. The jealous sister comes to the house with good food, but does not share it with the animals, so they do not give her advice. She is unkind to the old man (spirit) and is (severely) punished. Cf. Type 480.

|432       The Prince as Bird. The youngest of three sisters asks her father, when he goes on a journey, to bring her an unusual present (feather, plant, book, violin, mirror, pearl, etc.) [L221]. The father at first cannot find such a thing, but then he obtains it from an unknown prince. (Cf. Types 425A, 425B, 425C, 894.) The daughter uses the present to call its owner, who comes (in bird form) through her window [D641.1]. The envious sisters (stepmother) spy and discover the lover. They put knives or broken glass around the window [K2212.1, S181]. The prince is wounded and does not visit any more. The youngest daughter (disguises herself as a man [K1837] and) goes to look for her lover [H1385.5]. She overhears a conversa tion between birds (demonic beings, who meet in or under a tree) who speak about where the prince is and how he can be cured by a medi- cine [N452]. The woman prepares the medicine, finds her lover, and heals him. In payment, he gives her a present (ring, hair, shirt, horse ). The prince recognizes his love. Or, back home, she summons him by means of the feather (etc.). He comes but is angry because he believes that she had injured him, and she explains what really hap- pened. She shows him the second present (ring, shirt etc.) to prove that it was she who had cured him. They are reconciled [B642].

|433B      King Lindorm. (Including the previous Types 433, 433A, and 433C.) Cf. Type 430. This tale deals with a brave woman who marries a snake (worm, frog or toad, lizard, another animal). She disenchants him by kissing or embracing him or by sharing his bed [D735.1], or because she wears more shirts than he has layers of skin. (Previously Types 433 and 433A.) Cf. Types 425A, 441, 480, and 711. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A poor woman gives birth to a snake (a couple adopt a snake or a frog as their child). When the animal grows up he wants to marry the daughter of the king. The king sets impossible tasks, which the snake accomplishes (the snake frightens the king). The snake marries the princess, and after the wedding he turns into a handsome man (prince). (2) A childless queen (through a hasty wish [T513] or magic con- ception [T510]) gives birth to an animal son (snake, dragon, etc.) whom she keeps secret. When he grows up he wants to marry, but every woman who marries him is killed on her wedding night.   One courageous young woman (a mistreated stepdaughter) puts on seven shirts one on top of the other (on the advice of a wise woman, her dead mother). She challenges the snake to shed one  of his skins every time she takes off one of her shirts. When he is completely stripped, she whips him and then bathes him in milk [D766.1]. She lies down beside him and he turns into a handsome young man. (The skins are destroyed [D721.3].)   (3) A young woman marries a snake who gives her jewelry and turns into a handsome young man. The woman burns the snake skin and lives happily with her husband.   Another jealous woman tells her father she too wants to marry a snake. She is left in a room alone with such an animal, who kills her. (Previously Type 433C.)   In some variants after the husband is disenchanted, the woman is (slandered by a jealous woman and) banished. She disenchants a prince (who has been transformed into a bird) or a dead man, marries him, and gives birth to a son. Her first husband finds her after a long search. She must choose between the husbands and decides to stay with the first.

A prince in the form of a bird [D150] visits her three times and each time takes something away (jewelry, comb, mirror, hair ribbon). The princess becomes lovesick [T24.1] and goes to find the bird [H1385. 5]. She learns (from an old man) where the bird has gone [H1233.1] and discovers that he can change into a handsome young man. She becomes pregnant by him and, in his mother’s house, gives birth to a child. She learns (from him) how she can disenchant him. She ful fills the requirements (together with his mother) and he is dis en chanted. Cf. Type 425E.

|434*      The Diver. (Cola Pesce.) A man skilled in diving lives like a fish in the sea (and sometimes transforms himself into an ocean animal). The king summons him and orders him to go and report on vari- ous places  under the water. The diver complies at first, but then he refuses to go to a particularly dangerous place. The king throws his crown into the sea [H1132.1.7], sending the diver on a quest from which he never returns. In an Estonian oikotype, the diver is in love with a princess. A jealous suitor tells her [H911] to throw a piece of jewelry into the sea for the diver to retrieve [cf. H1132.1.7]. The diver transforms himself into a duck and accomplishes this task [D161, D641]. He turns back into his human form [D700] and marries the princess [L161]. 
Remarks: First appears in the 12th century in a poem by the Provençal poet Rai- 
mon Jordan. The form with the love story was popularized by Friedrich Schiller’s  
ballad Der Taucher.

|440       The Frog King Or Iron Henry. A young princess (youngest of three sisters) drops her golden ball into a well [C41.2], and a frog [B211. 7.1] gives it back to her. (In some variants the frog helps her with some other difficulty.) He makes her promise him that he may eat from her plate, drink from her cup, and sleep in her bed [S215.1]. The animal comes for his reward and the king insists the princess do as she had promised. Angry, she throws the frog at the wall and he turns into a handsome prince [D789]. In some variants the frog is disenchanted by means of a kiss, marriage, from being decapitated, etc. [D735.1, D743, D711]. In the Grimms’ version: When the prince takes the princess home in his carriage, they meet his faithful servant Henry, whose heart had broken when the prince was enchanted. The iron bands that had held it together break from joy [F875]. In some variants the bride has the iron bands on her heart, and they break from pain, not from joy. After the disenchantment, both partners may be put to a test. The princess searches all over the world for her bridegroom, and he must identify his true bride. Cf. Types 313, 425A.

|441       Hans My Hedgehog. A previously-childless couple (because of a hasty wish or a curse) have a son who is a hedgehog [C758.1, T554]. He becomes a swineherd in the forest, where the pigs thrive under his care. He gives directions to three (two) kings (merchant, count, king, one king three times, etc.) who have lost their way, and is promised one of their three daughters as his wife [S226]. Riding on a rooster, he goes to claim his bride three times. Two of the princesses refuse him and he scratches them, but the third agrees to marry him [B641.5]. On the wedding night (on the way to the church, after they have lived together), the animal’s skin is destroyed (the princess kisses the hedgehog, whips him, cuts off his head, etc.). The hedgehog is disenchanted and turns into a hand some young man [D721.3]. (The two other princesses kill themselves from jealousy and anger.) Cf. Types 425C, 433B.

|442       The Old Woman in the Forest (previously The Old Man in the Forest). Robbers attack a group of travelers, and a poor servant girl survives by hiding in a tree. In the evening a dove brings her keys that unlock three trees in which she finds food, clothing, and a bed. The dove tells her to go to a little house where she will find an old woman. She should not answer any of her questions but should bring back a plain ring, leaving the shiny one there. The girl does as the dove ordered, and does not let the old woman  distract her. She stops the old woman from running away with a bird cage, and finds the ring in the bird’s beak. While waiting for the dove, the girl puts the ring on her finger [D1076]. Immedi ately a tree envelops her with its branches and turns into a hand some young prince [D431.2] who explains that he had been en chanted by the witch. Other trees turn into servants and horses. The prince takes the girl to his kingdom, where they marry [L162]. Cf. Type 405.

(2) An unfaithful wife turns her husband into a dog [D141, K1535], which herds sheep and also rescues the king’s baby [D682. 3]. When he returns to his wife, she turns him into a bird [D151.8].

Remarks: Version (1) is traced to the Arabian Nights. Version (2) is thought to  
be a folktale from Syria that has spread to eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the  
Caucasus. Its characteristic features are the absence of the corpse-eating and the  
transformation of the dog into a bird.

|450       Little Brother and Little Sister. Little brother and little sister run away from their home because of their cruel stepmother [S31.5, S31] or because their parents want to eat them. In spite his sister’s warn- ing, the brother drinks from a spring or an animal’s track [D555] and is transformed into a deer [D114.1.1] (lamb [D135], goat). The children live together in the forest until a prince finds them [P253.2, N711.1]. The sister hides up in a tree but the prince tricks her into com ing down. She marries the prince and they take the animal brother  with them. The prince is absent when their child is born. The sister is re- placed by another bride [K1911, K1911.1.2], often the daughter of a bad woman (stepmother, witch, maid). The sister is thrown into the water [S142], transformed into a bird [D150] (fish [D170]), or swal- low ed by a fish [K1911.2.2.1]. She returns at night to suckle her child [E323.1.1, D688] and to look after her brother. A servant over hears the conversation between the animal brother and the sister and informs the prince [H13]. The false bride and her mother are punished. Cf. Type 403. In some variants the false bride and her mother want to kill the animal brother because they fear that the truth will be discovered. The cook saves him.

|451       The Maiden Who Seeks Her Brothers. (Including the previous Types 451A and 451*.) A girl rescues her twelve (seven, three, six) brothers [P253.0.5, P251.6.7, Z71.5.1] who had been transformed into animals (birds) [P253.2]. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms but they are often mixed with each other: (1) A stepmother transforms her stepsons into swans [D161.1] (ravens [D151.5]). The sister looks for her brothers and finds out how to release them: She has to be silent for some years [D758] and has to make shirts out of cotton-grass for the brothers [D753.1]. A king finds the young woman in the forest and marries her [N711]. In his absence she bears a child, but her mother-in-law takes it away and accuses her of eating the child [K2116.1.1] (having borne an animal). The young queen remains silent because of her brothers, even though she is to be executed. On her way to the funeral pyre her period of silence ends and her brothers are disenchanted. Every thing is explained and the mother-in-law is punished. In some variants the disenchantment of one brother is not com- plete (he keeps a wing) because the sister cried a tear when her child was taken away (did not completely finish his shirt). (2) A girl finds her brothers in a remote place and keeps house for them. They tell her to take care of the cat (dog), watch the fire, and be careful of the demonic neighbor (ogre, witch). Once she forgets to divide her food with the cat, so it puts out the fire. After the girl asks the neighbor for help, the ogre comes regularly to suck her blood. When the brothers discover this, they kill him. The girl takes flowers (herbs) from the grave of the ogre. Her brothers eat them and they are changed into oxen (sheep, birds). The episode of disenchantment is less important. (3) A mother (father) curses her sons because there is not enough to eat. They are transformed into ravens (swans). The sister seeks for them and asks for directions from the sun, moon, and stars [H1232]. She finds her brothers on a glass mountain (glass palace). To reach them she needs a little bone as a key (gets help from the wind). She releases her brothers and they go back home. In some variants the episode with marriage and slander fol- lows. Some variants start with the promise of the mother to sacrifice the brothers if a daughter (one more brother) is born [S272]. She tries to inform the boys after the birth by a sign [T595], but the wrong sign is sent [N344.1], so the brothers leave home [S272.1].

|459       The Make-Believe Son (Daughter). A king casts out his first wife because she is childless. Later a maidservant informs the king that this queen has born a son (daughter) but the king is not allowed to see it. The queen is supplied with a house and food. After some years the king arranges a marriage for his “child”. The maidservant makes an image of a youth or puts an animal in a sedan-chair. A god pities the queen and vivifies the image or turns the animal into a handsome youth (young woman). The king is rec- onciled with the queen. In some variants a prince falls in love with a doll thinking it is a young woman and he wants to marry her. Her “parents” convince him to marry the daughter of their neighbor.

|460A      The Journey to God (Fortune) (previously  The Journey to God to Receive Reward). (Including the previous Types 461A and 702A*.) A beggar wants to know why he is so poor. Or, a man has heard that God returns alms given away a thousand times [J1262.5.1]. This does not happen to him, so he goes to complain to God. On his journey to God (fortune, sun) the hero meets men, ani mals and objects that asks him (three) questions which he should ask God [H1291]: e.g. (1) a wolf (lion) asks why he is never full after eat ing (answer: he has to eat a stupid person), (2) a tree asks why it is so dry (answer: a treasure is buried under the roots), (3) a king asks why he cannot enlarge his kingdom by war (answer: she is a queen and she should marry), (4) some young women ask why they are not married (answer: they throw the dirt into the sun), (5) a fish asks why he is alone in a river (answer: he should drown or devour somebody), (6) a river wants to know why there is no life in it (answer: it should drown somebody). God answers the questions and on the homeward journey the traveler passes on the answers and is rewarded [H1292]. In some variants the traveler disclaims the rewards because God promised him wealth when he comes home. The wolf eats him up because the traveler is the most stupid person it ever met.

|460B      The Journey in Search of Fortune. (Including the previous Types 947B* and 947C*.) Two brothers live together on their farm but only one of them does the work. This brother wants to divide the farm so he can run his part alone. He works harder than his brother but after a while he wonders why the farm of his lazy brother is more suc cess- ful. He goes to find Fortune to ask her why [H1281]. On his way he meets things and people that give him questions, and he prom ises to ask Fortune for answers. When he arrives at Fortune he is told that he was born on an unlucky day. He sees that Fortune from day to day has less to eat. When her servants tell her how many people are born on that day she orders that they should have as much as she had on that day [N127.0.1]. On the homeward journey, the man answers the ques tions of the things and people he has met. Cf. Types 460A, 735. Sometimes he marries a lucky woman who brings him good luck. Later he gives someone who had asked him about the owner of the farm an untrue answer, and loses his luck. Cf. Type 737B*.

|461       Three Hairs from the Devil’s Beard. A poor young man wants to marry the daughter of a king (rich man). Her father tries to get rid of the young man by sending him to the devil (ogre) to bring him three hairs of the devil’s beard [H1273.2]. On his way some objects and animals ask the young man to ask the devil some questions [H1291]. A well wants to know why it has dried up, a tree wants to know why it is withered and the ferryman who rows the hero to the devil wants to know when he will be replaced. With the help of the devil’s mother (grandmother, wife) [G530.1], who asks her son when she louses him or when he is asleep, the young man gets the three hairs and the answers to his questions [H1292]. The ferryman has to give the oar to someone else [Q521.5], the spring of the well is blocked by a frog [A1111], and the roots of the tree are damaged by a treasure (snake). For his answers and help the young man receives a large reward, and the king has to accept him as son-in-law. The greedy king also wants to get treasures on the way to the devil, but he becomes the replacement for the ferryman [P413.1.1].

|462       The Outcast Queens and the Ogress Queen. (Including the previous Type 302A.) A king with three (seven, nine) wives has no children, but his wives become pregnant by eating a pear. When he is hunting [G405] he meets an ogress in form of a beautiful young woman whom he wants to marry [G264, G369.1.5]. She demands that his wives shall be killed (thrown into a pit [S435]) and as proof she asks for their eyes [S438] (and their hearts). In the forest (a pit) the blind ed outcast queens bear their children one after another, but because of their hunger they divide and eat them [G72.2]. Only the youngest queen saves her son [L71]. When the son grows up he takes care of the queens. The ogress queen recognizes him and tells him that he could get the eyes of the queens back if he does an errand for her. She gives him a Uriah letter and sends him to her mother [K511]. A helper changes the letter and the son is given the eyes, which he takes back to the queens. The king hears the truth and punishes the ogress queen.

|465       The  Man  Persecuted  Because  of  His  Beautiful  Wife.  (Including the previous Types 465A–465D.) A man marries a beautiful young woman  of supernatural origin: She is an animal bride (e.g. swan maiden [B642]) or she comes from God. She secretly keeps house for him. He discovers her and steals or burns her animal skin to prevent her from turning back into an animal. An envious king coverts this beautiful wife and, on advice of an evil adviser (vizier, old woman) [H911], he gives the hero (three) im- possible tasks to get rid of him [H931.1, H1211]: e.g. to build a castle or bridge in one night, to bring an exceptional baby (who under- stands 14 languages), to find a living harp [H1335], to harvest a field of grain in one night [H1090], to bring grapes in winter [H1023.3], to feed an army, to bring a huge tent that fits into one hand, to bring a very small (thumb-sized) man. The man accomplishes two of the tasks with the help of his wife [H1233.2.1]. The last task often leads him to the otherworld, and it is accomplished by one of the wife’s relatives who defeats the king. In some variants the king finds out about the beautiful young woman from a picture [T11.2] that the hero carries with him. Cf. Types 313, 402, 471, and 531.

They take a long journey through the otherworld and see strange things: a broad and a narrow road to heaven and hell [F171.2], fat cattle in a poor pasture and lean cattle in a green one (formerly rich and poor people) [F171.1], people and animals who argue [F171.3], etc. When the living man returns he finds that he has been away many (three) centuries [D2011]. All is changed and he knows no one. He dies or turns to dust. Cf. Type 471.

|470A      The Offended Skull. (Leontius, Don Juan, Festin de Pierre.) A drunken     man finds a skull (statue, a dead man hanging on the gallows), kicks it, and invites it to dinner. The skull (dead person) visits the living person and warns him about his bad behavior (kills him). On a return visit, the living person is a guest in the otherworld [C13]. In some variants the living person watches things in the other- world. In other variants the living person stays in the otherworld only for a short time, but finds that in this world a long time has passed and everything has changed [D2011].

|470B      The Land Where No One Dies [F116]. (Including the previous Type 470*.) A young man seeks for a land where no one dies. On his way to the otherworld he meets animals and men who do things for which they need a very long time (e.g. to clear away a mountain grain by grain), but they are not immortal. Finally he reaches the land where no one dies and lives there together with a young woman. When he longs for his home, the woman advises him against leav- ing. He insists on going, and she warns him not to touch the earth. He passes the people and animals which he had met on outward journey, but they have finished their work and died. Back home he meets a man with a carriage full of worn-cut shoes, and he gets off his horse to help the man. But it is death looking for him, and he dies.

|471       The Bridge to the Otherworld. Three brothers one after the other set out to look for work, or to search for their lost sister [H1385.6] who is married to someone in the otherworld. They are given a difficult job: They must herd seven foals (oxen) and at the end of the day they must bring back a sample of the animals’ food [H1251] (other things). In some variants they have to accompany a supernatural being (sun, death) and are not allowed to talk or to be distracted. The elder brothers fail: They are lured away by a bird, or per- suaded by an old woman to rest, or they fail to cross a certain bridge. They are transformed to stone [D231]. The youngest brother follows the instructions and passes across the bridge [F152, E481.2.1]. He sees visions [F171]: Fat cattle in a poor pasture and lean cattle in a green one [F171.1], stones striking on each other [F171.3], and ani- mals which, passing in and out of a church, become human beings and take part in the Holy Communion [F171.5]. The boy takes bread and wine from the altar and brings it to the supernatural being. The visions are explained [F171.0.1]: the fat and lean cattle in the differend pastures fomerly were rich and poor people. The striking stones were people who argued and are forced to continue their conflicts in the otherworld. The animals in the church are angels, priests, or transformed princes. The youngest brother is rewarded and his brothers are disenchanted [R155.1, H1242].

Remarks: Documented in the 19th century but the motif of the journey to the  
other world is much older. Contains many vision motifs.

|475       The Man as Heater of Hell’s Kettle. A poor soldier (servant) takes a job (for seven years) in hell [M210]. Or, parents wish that the devil will take their greedy child [M411.1]. The soldier has to heat the kettles and is not allowed to wash [C721.1] or comb himself. He is also not allowed to look into the pots [C325]. He breaks this rule and finds his former masters or un friendly relatives in the kettles. He heats them even more. Or, he releases poor souls (transformed into animals). In payment he receives sweepings which later change into gold [D475.1]. Or, on the advice of a soul he has released, he asks for some- thing worthless (an old piece of clothing) that gives money. The host at an inn where he stays for the night robs him of his gold [D861.1], but with the devil’s help he recovers it [cf. D885]. Cf. Types 332C*, 360, 361, and 563.

|476       Coal Turns into Gold. This miscellaneous type consists of various tales (mostly legends) in which coal turns into gold (silver). Cf. Types 476*, 476**. E.g.: (1) A person finds (the devil gives him) some coal that turns into gold [D475.1.1]. In some variants the person has to throw a rosary (bridle) onto the coal to effect the transformation. (2) A person breaks apart glowing coals and finds a treasure under them [N532]. (3) The gold (transformed coal) brings unexpected good fortune to a poor person (child, charcoal burner, maidservant, shepherd, orphan). (4) A maidservant gets glowing coals for her kitchen fire. The next morning, she finds pieces of gold in the ashes [F342.1]. Her master takes the gold away from her. (5) A man who wants to smoke his pipe has no lighter. He takes a piece of coal from the fire, but his pipe will not light from it even on the third try. When he knocks out his pipe, a piece of gold falls out of it.

Someone (an animal who turns into a supernatural being) summons a midwife to help a supernatural being (dwarf, water spirit, elf, forest spirit, human woman who has been kidnapped by fairies) give birth [B81.6, F372, F372.1, F451.5.5, F333]. As payment for her services, the midwife is given something apparently worthless (coal, leaves, garbage, onions, garlic), most of which she throws away carelessly. Later she finds that the small part she still has, has turned to gold [D475.1]. She looks for what she lost but cannot find it (the gift means danger of life). Cf. Types 476, 476*.

|480       The Kind and the Unkind Girls (previously The Spinning-Women by the Spring. The Kind and the Unkind Girls) [Q2]. A girl is mistreated by her stepmother [S31] and has to work very hard [H934.3]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A girl loses an object which is carried off by a river (blown away by the wind), and runs after it (a spindle [N777.4]) [N777.2, N791]. She comes upon an old woman (ogress) who asks her to clean (disarrange) and to louse her head [H935, Q41.2, G466]. When the old woman lets her choose a box as her reward, she chooses the plain one [L211]. (2) A girl falls into a well (is pushed in, jumps in after an object she has dropped [N777]), or follows a rolling cake (ball of yarn, etc. [H1226]). She encounters various animals, objects, or people who ask her for help: e.g. a cow wants to be milked, an old man or woman to be loused or fed, an oven to be emptied of bread, an apple tree to be shaken [D1658.1.5]. The girl helps them all. Then she arrives at the house of an old woman (Frau Holle, old man, supernatural beings like a giant or the twelve months) where she is assigned tasks [G204, H935]: e.g. she has to do the household or farm work, has to feed or louse the demon [G466], has to comb the hair of fairies [H1192], has to carry water in a sieve [H1023.2] or wash black wool white [H1023.6]. She is very helpful and hard-working. In the end she is is rewarded [Q41] with gold, jewels, etc., becomes more beautiful [D1860], or jewels fall from her mouth [D1454.2]. Or, she can choose her reward and is very modest but the reward changes into wealth when she reaches home. In some variants she is forbidden to enter a certain room [C611]. When she breaks this rule, she becomes covered with gold and flees. The grateful animals [B350], objects [D1658], and people of her out- ward journey help her escape from the demon. After she arrives home, her envious stepmother sends her own daughter on the same journey. This girl goes through the same situ- ations but she refuses help, disobeys, and is unkind. She is punished severely (frogs fall from her mouth [M431.2], horns grow on her head, or she is disfigured, beaten or killed). In some variants the stepmother is also punished. In the end the kind young woman often marries a prince.  Cf. Types 431, 480A, and 1180.

|480A      Girl and Devil in a Strange House. (Including the previous Type 1441.) A girl leaves home because of her cruel stepmother. On her way she helps some animals and takes them with her. During the night they stay in a strange house. A demon (devil) tries to enter (to dance with the girl, to marry her), but the girl refuses to open the door unless he gives her certain valurable gifts. When morning comes, the demon has not fulfilled all the wishes so he cannot enter the house. He loses his strength and goes away. This is often followed by account of the unfriendly stepsister who gives no help to the animals and is killed by the demon. Cf. Types 431, 480.

|500       The Name of the Supernatural Helper. (E.g. Tom Tit Tot, Rumpel- stilzchen, Trillevip.) A father (mother) boasts that his daughter can spin gold or impossible amounts of yarn. Or, a mother beats her daughter because she is lazy. The king asks why and the mother says she will not stop spinning [H914]. The young woman’s talent is to be tested and she is shut in a room to spin [H1021.8, H1092]. If she fails she will die, but if she suc ceeds the king will marry her. She cries. A supernatural being (a little man) agrees to help her [D2183] if she will promise him her first child (herself) if she cannot guess his name [H521, S222, S222.1]. In some variants she has to remember his name after a long time. The young woman passes the test and the king marries her. After a year the little man, certain that she could not guess his name, comes back to take her child away. By chance the name is discovered (by a servant, the husband or the woman herself) when the little man sings it triumphantly in the forest [N475]. When the woman says the correct name to the helper he vanishes or sinks into the earth [C432.1].

|501       The Three Old Spinning Women (previously The Three Old Women Helpers). Through a false boast of her mother [H914] or of a young woman herself [H915], she is compelled to spin an impossible amount of thread [H1092]. If she is successful a prince will marry her. She  receives  help  from  three  old  women  who  are  deformed from too much spinning: the first has an enormous foot, the second has drooping lips, and the third has a thick thumb [G201.1, G244, D2183]. In payment she must invite them to her wedding. The prince sees them and exclaims in disgust. They tell him that their de formi ties come from spinning. He swears that he will never let his wife spin again.

|502       The Wild Man. A king catches a wild man (Iron John) and puts him into a cage, forbidding anyone to set him free. His son frees the pris- oner because his ball rolls into the cage or because he feels pity for him. The prince is afraid of his father’s anger and leaves home (his father drives him away to be killed or sends him to another king) along with a servant. On their way the servant persuades the prince to exchange clothes. The prince becomes a servant at the court of another king. At a tournament he appears unrecognized three times on a splendid horse [R222] which he received from the wild man and wins the hand of a princess. Or, he wins the princess because he has helped her father in war [L161]. Often the wild man is disenchanted [G671]. In some variants the prince works for a while at the wild man’s house where he disobeys instructions (e.g. looks into a forbidden chamber [C611], cares for a horse although it is not allowed [B316]) and his hair turns to gold. Cf. Type 314. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 300, 314, and also 313, 314A, 510, 530, 531, 532, 570, and 850. 
Remarks: Type 502 is often the first part of Type 314, so these types are not clearly  
differentiated. Documented in an Icelandic Saga of the 13th century, see Snorri  
Sturluson, Heimskringla (1220/30).

|503       The Gifts of the Little People. A hunchbacked man takes part in a dance of the witches or people from below the earth (elves, fairies, dwarfs) [F331.1]. He sings their song or adds a missing rhyme or more weekdays [F331.3, F331.4]. As a reward they remove his hump [F344.1] or give him gold [F342.1]. A greedy neighbor (hunchbacked person) wants to get the same reward, but he ruins the song or is unfriendly. The little people add the hump of the other man to his own, or give him coals instead of gold [J2415]. Cf. Type 480D*. 

Remarks: Some motifs appear in the 17th century in Ireland and Italy.

|505       The Grateful Dead. (Including the previous Types 506–506B, 506**, and 508.) One introductory episode is combined with various main parts in which a man wins a princess and a castle. The ending is also very similar. Introductory episode: While traveling, a man sees a corpse which is not allowed to be buried or is ill-treated by its creditors [Q271.1]. He uses all his money to pay the debts of the dead man and for his funeral. Later he meets the grateful dead man in the form of a traveling companion (old man, servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 507. Main parts: (1) The man ransoms a princess, who had been kidnapped, from slavery and marries her [R111.1.6, L161]. While the man is away in another country, the father of the princess recognizes the sail of the ship which is emboidered with the princess’s coat of arms and learns that his daughter is alive. When the man goes back to fetch his wife, he finds that she has been abducted by one of her father’s courtiers. The man searches for his wife, and the traveling com panion helps him to return to his father-in-law’s court [R163]. There the man discloses his identity as the husband of the princess and gets his bride back. (Previously Type 506A.) (2) The man rescues a young woman from robbers. On their way home by ship the man is thrown overboard by a rival [S142] but is rescued by the traveling companion [R163] and brought to the prin- cess. He is recognized by means of a ring or otherwise [H94.4, H11.1]. The rival is unmasked and punished. (Previously Type 506B.) (3) The traveling companion equips the man with a magnificent horse. A tournament takes place in which the winner is to marry a prin cess [H972, H331.2]. The man wins her. (Previously Type 508.) Ending: The traveling companion asks for his part of the winnings and wants to divide the princess (their baby) [M241.1]. When the man, trying to save the princess, offers the whole kingdom, the traveling companion reveals himself as the grateful dead man, says his de- mand was only a test of faith, and vanishes. In some variants the grateful dead man is a saint, who helps the hero because he has redeemed a saint’s picture that was mistreated [N848.1]. (Previously Type 506**.)

|507       The Monster’s Bride. (Including the previous Types 507A–507C.) This type consists of one introductory part and two different main parts. The ending is often the same. Introductory part: While traveling a young man provides a suitable funeral for an unknown man whose corpse was mistreated by creditors [Q271.1]. Later he meets a traveling companion (servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 505. On their way, the traveling companion obtains (three) magic ob- jects (e.g. boots, magic hood, cloak, sabre, feather). The young man woos a princess who is in love with a magician (ogre, devil). Her suitors have to guess her thoughts three times (bring hidden objects [H322.1], solve difficult tasks). If they fail they are executed. Main part: (1) With the help of the magic objects, the companion of the young man becomes invisible and follows the princess on her way to the magician. There he finds the solutions [H972]. He frees the princess by beating, burning, or killing the magician [T172.2.1]. On the wed- ding night the young man has to submerge the princess (in different forms) three times in a bath to release her from her en chant ment [D766.1]. (Previously Type 507A.) Cf. Type 306. (2) All bridegrooms of a princess have perished during the bridal night [T172.0.1]. The young man marries her on advice of his com- panion. A snake (snakes) comes into the chamber or crawls out of the princess’s mouth to kill the young man, but the companion kills it. (Previously Types 507B, 507C.) Cf. Types 840, 1145. Ending: (After a year) the companion demands his half of the winnings and divides the princess in two parts. Snakes crawl out of her body. He puts the halves together and the princess is disenchanted for- ever. In a few variants the companion only pretends to divide the prin- cess [M241.1] to test the faith of the young man, and then dis closes his identity as the grateful dead man. Cf. Type 505.

|510A      Cinderella. (Cenerentola, Cendrillon, Aschenputtel.) A young woman is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters [S31, L55] and has to live in the ashes as a servant. When the sisters and the stepmother go to a ball (church), they give Cinderella an impossible task (e.g. sorting peas from ashes), which she accomplishes with the help of birds [B450]. She obtains beautiful clothing from a super natural being [D1050.1, N815] or a tree that grows on the grave of her deceased mother [D815.1, D842.1, E323.2] and goes unknown to the ball. A prince falls in love with her [N711.6, N711.4], but she has to leave the ball early [C761.3]. The same thing happens on the next evening, but on the third evening, she loses one of her shoes [R221, F823.2]. The prince will marry only the woman whom the shoe fits [H36.1]. The stepsisters cut pieces off their feet in order to make them fit into the shoe [K1911.3.3.1], but a bird calls attention to this deceit. Cin- derella who had been first hidden from the prince, tries on the shoe and it fits her. The prince marries her.

|510B      Peau d’Asne (previously The Dress of Gold, of Silver, and of Stars [Cap o’ Rushes]). (Cap o’Rushes, Donkey Skin, All Kinds of Fur, Allerleirauh.) A king promises his wife on her deathbed [M255] only to marry another woman who is as beautiful as she is (whom a par- ticu lar ring fits). Because she is the only one who meets this condi- tion, the king wants to marry his grown daughter. In order to delay the wedding, the young woman asks him to give her dresses like the sun (gold), the moon (silver), and stars (diamonds), and a coat made of many different kinds of fur (a covering of wood). After he provides all these, the daughter runs away from her father [T311.1] and, disguised in the ugly skin [K521.1, F821.1.3, F821.1.4], works as a kitchen maid (goose-girl) in another castle. Cf. Types 706, 706C. When a series of feasts is held in the castle where she works, the young woman secretly puts on her splendid dresses. The prince falls in love with her [N711.6] but does not recognize her as the kitchen maid [R255]. On the following days he treats the kitchen maid bad- ly. During the feasts he asks the beautiful woman where she comes from, and she gives cryptic answers that refer to how he had treated the kitchen maid [H151.5]. He gives her a ring. Then the prince be- comes lovesick. In her character as kitchen maid, she slips his ring into his soup (bread). He finds her [H94.2, H94.4] and marries her. Sometimes the young woman is discovered while she is bathing or dressing instead of being recognized through a token. 

Combinations: 403, 510A, 511, 706, and 923. 
Remarks: This form of the incest motif (the king wants to marry his daughter  
after the death of his wife) is often documented independently since the 12th  
century.

|511       One-Eye, Two-Eyes, Three-Eyes. (Including the previous Types 452C*, 511A, and 511A*.) A girl (boy) has a stepmother who does not give her enough to eat but makes her herd cattle and spin a great amount of flax. She tells her sorrows to a (little colored) cow (red ox, god- mother), who gives her food [B535.0.1] and helps her with her work.  

FFC 284                            Tales of Magic                                297 The stepmother wants to know why the girl is so well fed, and sends her one-, two- and three-eyed daughters one after the other to find out. The girl sings One-Eye [F512.1] and Two-Eyes to sleep, so they learn nothing, but she forgets to sing to the third eye of Three-Eyes [F512.2.1.1], who tells her mother about the cow [D830.1]. The stepmother determines to have the cow slaughtered. When the girl tells the animal this, the cow tells her to plant its bones (in- testines, or not to eat its meat). She does as she was told, and a tree (apple tree) grows which continues to help her [B100.1, D1461, D1470.2]. A rich man notices the tree and asks for an apple. When the step- sisters try to pick one, a branch scratches them. Only the girl herself can pick the fruit [D590, H31.12], and the rich man marries her [L162]. Often the tree goes (is taken) with them. The stepmother and step- sisters are punished. Sometimes, the child and the cow run away when the stepsis- ter discovers their secret. They pass through brass, silver, and gold forests [F811.1]. In each forest, the cow warns the child not to pick the leaves [C513], but the child disobeys. A brass etc. ox (wolf, lion) comes and fights with the cow of the child. The last of these over- comes the cow, which, before it dies, tells the child to save (plant) some part of its body (horn, hoof, skin) because it will help him later [B505, B115]. (Previously Type 511A.) Or, the cow dies after the escape and turns into an angel that flies to heaven. (Previously Type 511A*.) In some variants another woman wants to marry the girl’s father. She promises to take good care of the girl and convinces her to kill her mother by having her look into a chest and dropping the lid on her neck. Cf. Type 720. In other variants, after the stepmother discovers the secret of the cow, she tries to kill the girl in a covered pit filled with burning coals . A dog warns the girl in front of the pit. The stepmother kills the dog and the next day the girl falls into the pit. She is burned up, the cow licks the ashes, and a duck comes out. When her brother comes home, the girl in the form of this duck tells him what happened. He punishes the stepmother. (Previously Type 452C*.)

|513A      Six Go through the Whole World. A discharged soldier (fool) ac- quires many (six) traveling companions with extraordinary abilities [F601]: e.g. one who runs fast [F681.1], one who eats great quan- tities [F632, F633], one who produces (can withstand) severe frost [D2144.1.2], one who can shoot and hit the left eye of a fly from far away [F661.5.3], one with acute hearing [F641.1, F641.2, F641.3], one who can make himself taller, and one who can rip up trees by their roots [F621]. In order to avenge himself on the king who dis charged him, the soldier enters a contest to marry the princess [H331]. She has agreed to marry anyone who beats her at running [H331.5.1]. The king permits the soldier to employ his helpers. The runner overtakes the princess, but he falls asleep and is awakened just in time by the sharpshooter. In an effort to prevent the wedding, the king assigns other tasks: eating (drinking) a huge quantity [H1114, H1142], which the eater accomplishes, and staying in an oven [H1511], which the freezing man accomplishes. Finally the king offers the soldier as much money as he and his companions can carry [cf. H1127] if he will give up his claim for the princess. The companions ruin the king and overcome his army. The same motifs appear together in a reduced form. A prince (young man) is looking for a wife. He takes as servants men who help him accomplish tasks that have been set for suitors who hope to marry the princess [F605.2]. In the end he marries her [L161].

|513B      The Land and Water Ship. A king offers his daughter in marriage [H335, H331] to whoever can build a ship that can travel on land as well as in water [D1533.1.1]. Three brothers attempt this task, but the older two are unkind to an old man (little man) who asks what they want to do. The third who answers honestly gets help from the old man and is then able to build the ship (in one night) [N825.2]. The old man also tells him to take with him anyone whom he meets. These turn out to be men with unusual abilities [F601]. See Type 513A. When the young man brings the ship, the king is amazed, but since the young man is of humble origin, he gives him further (diffi- cult) tasks to prevent the marriage. The young man accomplishes them all with the help of his companions [F601.2] (see Type 513A) and marries the princess [L161].

|514       The Shift of Sex. A king who has only (three) daughters must send a son to war (needs a son for other reasons). The daughters ask to be allowed to pretend to be men, but only the youngest passes tests which her father sets. He gives her magic objects (a horse) and she goes to the war. In some variants a queen has only daughters and, afraid of her husband’s anger, pretends that the youngest is a boy. Or for other reasons a woman disguises herself as a man and goes out into the world. The woman in man’s clothing [K1837] accomplishes heroic deeds and/or goes into service with a king. The daughter (sister) of the king falls in love with her and wants to marry her. The woman in man’s clothing refuses, or the marriage is unconsumated. In order to get rid of the “servant/husband”, impossible tasks are set. The woman is able to accomplish these with the help of a helper (several helpers, the horse). Cf. Types 461, 465, 513A–513C. In some variants the tests concern the gender of the “servant”, which had been doubted. For example, her manner of eating and her behavior in a garden are tested, or she is asked to bathe with the brothers of the princess. At the end of the tale, the woman in man’s clothing is trans formed into a man. This happens either through a demon’s curse [D11] or a saint’s help, seldom by accident. Then the princess is happy with her husband and the former woman becomes king. Her parents are happy that finally they have a real son. 

Combinations: 884. 
Remarks: Great variety of motifs in different episodes. Some variants lack the  
change of sex. Some motifs appear in earlier Oriental tales, but literary versions

|514**     A Young Woman Disguised as a Man is Wooed by the Queen (pre- viously The Court Physician). (Including the previous Types 881* and 884A.) A young woman in man’s clothing [K1837] works as a doctor [K1825.1.2] (messenger) for a king. The king’s wife falls in love with the doctor but is repulsed (accuses him of attempting to seduce or rape her [K2111]). Angry, she sets an impossible task, which the doctor must perform on pain of death. Often it is to enable a dumb person to speak. The dumb person reveals the intention of the queen, who is executed. The king marries the young woman who had posed as a doctor. Cf. Types 880, 881, 881A, and 884.

|516       Faithful John. A prince wants to marry a beautiful princess from a distant land because he heard her name, saw her picture [T11.2, T11.2.1], or saw her in a dream [T11.3]. A faithful servant (adoptive brother, a dead man whom he has redeemed [P361, P311, P273.1]) helps him in this pursuit. The servant poses as a merchant and traps the princess on a ship [K1332], or he enters her room by hiding in a statue of an animal [K1341] (in a magical manner). The princess is kidnapped or goes voluntarily. Cf. Type 854. On the way back, the helper overhears creatures (birds [B211.3, B143]) [N451] prophesy the future. They say that certain dangers that threaten the bridal couple can be averted by particular actions, but also that anyone who reveals this will be turned to stone. The dangers are a horse (other animal) that will run away with (kill) the bridegroom, poisoned food [H1515] (drink, clothing [H1516]), and a dragon who will kill the bridegroom on his wedding night [T172.2]. When the helper acts to avert the dangers, his actions appear excessive and irrational. When he kills the dragon, drops of its blood fall on the bride’s breast. He removes them (with his mouth, or he sucks them out of her body while she is unconscious). The prince construes this as a sexual attack and condemns the helper to death [N342.1]. Before the sentence can be carried out, he justifies himself [C423.4] and is turned to stone step by step [C961.2]. The prince and his wife mourn the helper. The prince discovers (in a dream) that he can bring his friend back to life by sacrificing his own children. He kills (injures) them and rubs the stone man with their blood [E113, D766.2, S268]. The helper is restored to life and he revives the children. Cf. Types 505, 507, and 916.

|516C      Amicus and Amelius (previously St. James of Galicia). Two friends who look exactly alike assist each other in time of need. When one of them, in elder versions named Amelius, is challenged to a sword- fight, the other, Amicus, who is a better swordsman, takes his place. Amelius remains behind with Amicus’s wife, and puts a sword in the middle of the marriage bed at night [T351]. Amicus wins the fight for his friend. Later, Amicus contracts leprosy. An angel tells them that he will be healed if he bathes in the blood of Amelius’s children. Amelius cuts off their heads to save his friend [S268]. The children are restored to life. Or, because his mother had made a vow before his birth, a young

He meets a friend through an apple test: a true friend is one who, when he shares an apple, takes the smaller half [H1558.0.1.1] (who notices that an apple is missing). When the friend is killed (very ill) and can be cured only by the blood of the children of the young man, he sacrifices his children in order to save his friend [S268]. The children are later restored to life. Cf. Types 303, 516. 

Remarks: Documented ca. 1100 as a Christian legend in Vita Amicii et Amelii caris- 
simorum. Central motifs (true friendship, exchange of roles, the healing property  
of blood of innocent children) were made into a folktale in Romance-language  
countries. The names Amicus and Amelius are only used in the Chris tian legend  
and subsequent retellings.

|517       The Boy Who Understands the Language of Birds (previously The Boy  who  Learned  Many  Things).  A  boy  who  understands  (has learned) the language of birds [B215.1, B216] is asked by his father to tell what he has heard. He is at first reluctant, but then repeats the birds’ prophecy [B143, M312.0.2] that the father will humble himself before the son (will serve him, bring water for the son to wash his hands). The father pushes the son into the sea (drives him out, tries to kill him) [M373]. The son is rescued and goes into the service of a foreign ruler. By hearing what birds say, he frees this ruler from ravens that annoy him. The son is honored and is given half the kingdom, and he mar- ries a princess. In his new high position, he goes back to his parents, who serve him without recognizing him [N682]. Cf. Types 671, 671E*, 725, and 781.

A (young) man on a journey meets three (two) men (giants, devils), who are quarreling over the division of three magic objects (e.g. cloak of invisibility, seven mile boots, wishing hat, flying carpet) (which they have inherited). The man promises to render a judgment, but he asks first to try out the objects (to run a race against the owners). He takes the magic objects and runs away with them. He uses them later to accomplish difficult tasks [D832].

|519       The Strong Woman as Bride (Brunhilde). A prince falls in love with a powerful young woman who will marry only someone whose own power is as strong as hers. Suitors who try and fail are put to death. Although he is warned against it, the prince sets out along with a strong companion to win her [T58]. When they arrive, the helper storms the woman’s defenses, slays her army, and overcomes the woman herself on his master’s behalf [Z3]. He defeats her in single combat (using a cloak of invisibility): e.g. in a shooting contest with a giant bow [H345.1], in breaking her wild horse [H345.2, F601.2, H345]. On the wedding night the strong woman tries to crush the prince [T173.1]. The helper secretly takes his master’s place and beats her for three nights with whips made of three kinds of metal [K1844.1]. When the woman discovers the impersonation, she orders the feet of the helper to be cut off [Q451.2, S162] and banishes the prince to the pigsty [K1816.6]. The helper finds a blind companion and together they force a demon to heal them with Water of Life [D1500.1.18]. The helper re- turns, overcomes (kills) the strong woman, and rescues the prince [R169.4]. 

Combinations: 300A, 303, and 315. 
Remarks: The figure of the strong woman is often documented in epic poems  
and heroic songs, e.g. in the ancient Greek myth of the Amazons and in the Nibe- 
lungenlied with Brunhilde.

|530       The Princess on the Glass Mountain. (Including the previous Type 530B*.) A narrative in three parts with several different forms and combinations: (1) At night, a field (haystack, garden) belonging to a family with three sons is robbed (devastated). The sons keep watch. The elder two fall asleep (run away in fear), but the youngest (helped by a mouse, frog, old man) stays awake and captures three magic horses [H1471]. They promise to help him in the future, and he lets them go free [B315, B401, B181]. Or, hiding in a mound of hay, he is carried home by a giant. He kills the giant and finds his treasure (helpful spirits) and three horses [B315, B401, B181]. In some variants a dying father orders his sons to watch over his grave. Out of indifference (fear), the older brothers leave this task to the youngest [H1462]. At the grave he receives three horses, as well as a pipe (stick, bridle) to use to summon them. (2) The king’s daughter is offered in marriage to whoever can ride to the top of a mountain (made of glass, crystal, marble) [F751, H331.1.1, H331.1.2] and/or take a golden apple from its summit. Or he must kiss the princess at the summit and take her ring or scarf [R111.2.2]. In some variants he must jump up to the princess who sits at the window of the fourth story of a building [F1071] (and take her ring), or jump over a grave [F989.1, H331.1.3, H331.1.4]. The young man disguises himself and, with the help of the magic horses, succeeds three times. On the third time, the king (princess) gives him a token (marks him, he is injured). He goes away. (3) Messengers (king, princess) look for the champion, and/or all the men are ordered to march past the princess (the princess sum mons all the men to a feast). Through his token (mark, injury), the youth is discovered at home (in the king’s household) [H80]. He marries the princess. In some variants the horses are disenchanted and become princes (princesses). Cf. Types 313, 314, 314A. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 314, and also 300, 301, 302, 313, 314, 314A, 400, 502, 530A, 531, 550,  
551, and 675. 
Remarks: Many narratives classified as Type 530 in the catalogs have only the  
introduction of the type, and in some the motif of the glass mountain plays only  
a marginal part.

|530A      The Pig with the Golden Bristles. A king commands his (three) sons- in-law to get magic animals: a pig with golden bristles, a golden- horned stag, wild boars from the sea, etc. The stupidest of the sons (another foolish boy) gets these wonders, but trades them to his brothers in return for their cut-off fingers and pieces of skin from their backs. At the feast where the brothers are honored, they are exposed as cheaters by the pieces of evidence shown by the fool.

|531       The Clever Horse (previously Ferdinand the True and Ferdinand the False). (Including the previous Type 513C.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a clever horse. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms, “The Godchild of the King and the Unfaithful Companion”, “The Golden-haired Maiden”, and “The Clever Horse”. A poor boy goes in search of his godfather [H1381.2.2.1], the king (God, Virgin Mary, etc.) [N811]. On the way he obtains a clever magic  horse that offers to help him [B211.1.3, B133, B401]. Against the horse’s advice [B341] he picks up a glimmering feather (golden hair, golden horse-shoe, other bright object), which he later gives to the king. En route the boy is accompanied by a companion (devil, beard less man, Gypsy, etc.) who forces him to change places [K1934] and to swear silence. At the king’s court the boy is employed as a groom. He helps different animals, who in return promise to help him [B350, B391, B470, B501]. A treacherous employee of the king (the boy’s companion) slan- ders him to the king, saying that he had boasted he could find the bird that had lost the feather and/or to bring the golden-haired maiden (princess) as bride for the king [T11.4.1, H75.2, H1213.1, H1381.3.1.1]. On pain of death he is assigned to accomplish the dangerous tasks [H911]. He succeeds with help of his horse. The abducted princess refuses to marry the old king until she receives certain things (her castle, keys that have fallen into the sea, water of life, etc.). The boy brings these with the help of his horse and of the helpers he had met on his way (grateful animals) [H982, B450]. As the last condition for the marriage the princess demands the boy be killed (burned, beheaded, dismembered, by taking a bath in boil- ing milk or oil of a herd of wild mares, by water of death, etc.) The horse saves the boy or he is resuscitated by the princess, rejuvenated,  and beautified [E15.1, E12, D1865.1]. The king has the same thing done to him with fatal results (the princess does not resuscitate him, he dies in the milk, etc.) [J2411.1]. The magic horse turns into a young woman (man) [B313, D131, D700]. The boy marries her (the princess) and becomes king. Cf. Type 328.

|533       The Speaking Horsehead. A princess is sent to her fiancé, a prince of a foreign country. Her mother orders a maidservant to accompany her, and gives her a small rag with some drops of her mother’s blood to protect her and sends a speaking horse to take care of her. When during the journey the princess loses her mother’s charm, the waiting-maid gains control of the princess [K2252, K1911.1.1], forces her to change clothes and roles [K1934], and to swear an oath of secrecy [K1933]. The prince unwittingly marries the maidservant, and the real prin- cess is employed as a goose-girl [K1816.5]. When the false wife orders the horse to be killed [B335], the princess persuades a farm hand to hang the horsehead on the wall by a gate where she passes  daily. Every day she greets the horsehead with a formula, and it an swers regretting the injury that is being done to her [D1011, B133.3]. When she speaks a magic formula to make the hat of a goose- boy fly away (to keep an obstrusive goose-boy away from her), he com plains to the king. Thereupon the old king starts observing her and finally makes her tell her life story to a stove [H13.2.7] (her dog [H13. 1.2]) (cf. Types 870, 894). The truth comes to light, the real bride marries the prince, and the maidservant is punished (she un wit tingly declares her own judgment). Cf. Types 403, 425A.

|537       The Flight on the Grateful Eagle (previously The Marvelous Eagle Gives the Hero a Box). A man aims his gun three times at an eagle. When suddenly the bird speaks like a human being [B211.3], the man spares it. The eagle has a broken wing and the man nurses the bird for several years until it recovers, spending all his wealth. The grateful bird [B380, Q45] carries the man on his back across the sea [B552] to his kingdom [B222]. On the way it frightens him three times by nearly dropping him into the sea (as the hunter had aimed three times at the bird). On the other side of the sea the eagle’s father (sister) gives the man a box [D1174.1], telling him not to open it before he reaches home [C321]. Overcome with curiosity, the man opens the box on the way, and a town (castle) springs out of it. In order to put the town back into the box, the man promises his (unborn) son to the devil (super natural being) [S222]. The tale is usually an introduction to Type 313B.

|540       The Dog and the Sailor (previously The Dog in the Sea). An unhappy sailor in misery tries to drown himself, but in the water (on shore) he meets a dog (poodle) who offers its help [B541.4]. On the dog’s advice he takes it along with him to sea. After three heavy storms (several years) the dog orders the sailor to jump into the water. At the bottom of the sea he finds a castle and a beautiful woman. The dog had warned him of her seductive powers, so he kills her. Inside the castle the dog is waiting for him. After en- during three painful nights (after accomplishing special tasks), the sailor cuts off the dog’s head, whereupon the prince who had once been enchanted by his mother-in-law (witch, father) is disenchanted [D711] and returns to human form.

|545A      The Cat Castle. A poor girl reaches the king’s castle with the help of a cat (dog) [B211.1.8, B422, B421, B435.1, B581.1.2], (her sole in heri t- ance [N411.1.1]). On the cat’s advice she pretends to be the princess of the castle of the cats. The prince falls in love with her (the royal couple receives her). When she looks out of the window and sees her parents quarreling of a pot of porridge, she laughs. Being asked why, she does not want to reveal her humble origin, so she pretends to have been laughing at the poor condition of the king’s castle. The girl’s noble origin is tested. When she says she possesses a castle more beautiful than that of the king, she is asked to show it. The cat goes to the castle of a troll (giant, giantess) [F771.4.1] and kills him (by making him look into the sun). The girl becomes the owner of the castle and marries the king (guests are received: The cat demands to be killed by the girl and turns into a prince [D711]. He marries the girl) [B582.1.2]. Cf. Type 505. 

Remarks: Very similar to Type 545B, esp. in its single motifs. Variants of Types  
545A and 545B are often mixed with each other or they are not clearly differ- 
entiated. Occurs mostly in northern Europe.

|545B      Puss in Boots. An animal (cat [B211.1.8, B422], fox [B435.1], jackal [B435.2], monkey [B441.1], etc.) intends to help a poor man (out of obligation) to become rich (by marrying him to the princess) [B580, B581, B582.1.1]. In order to gain the emperor’s confidence, the ani- mal tells him that the poor man is very wealthy [K1917.3]. When the poorly dressed future bridegroom travels to his bride’s residence, the animal simulates an accident (robbery), in which all his clothes (horses, bride presents, wedding guests) are lost [K1952. 1.1]. There- upon the king gives the poor man good clothes and he is accepted as a bridegroom. When the man has to display his property, the animal leaves before him and coerces the shepherds and farmers to say that their herds and farmland belong to the poor man. The animal kills the real owner of the properties, a demon (dragon, ogre, giant, witch, magician) by burning, slaying, shooting or through a trick [F771.4.1, K722]. When the bride arrives with her entourage, the bridegroom presents himself as the real owner of the property. The animal tests the gratitude of the poor man by feigning death (it becomes a human when it is decapitated [D711]). In some variants the man behaves ungrateful or does not keep his promise.

|545A*     The Magic Castle. (Including the previous Type 512*.) A poor girl gives all her food to an animal (cat, dog, fox) or to an old beggar (Christ). Afraid that her grandmother (mother, aunt) will punish her, she runs away and comes to a castle. (On the way, supernatural beings transform her adornments from flowers, snail shells, etc. into precious jewels.) She becomes queen. The grandmother comes and demands the food that she had given away. But the grandmother is pushed off the balcony (ladder), dies, and turns into a grapevine (tree), which con tinues to question the queen about the missing food. The queen laughs at this and her husband demands that she should explain why she laughed. She replies hastily that the toilet brush is more beautiful than his beard (her own castle or garment is more beautiful than his). The animal (supernatural being) helps her to prove this by giving her a bejeweled toilet brush (castle). In some variants a girl is cast out by her older sisters. On the ad- vice of an old man, she goes to work in a castle. When the owner’s son asks to see the girl’s own castle, the old man helps her to pro duce one. (Previously Type 512*.)

He goes to the king and asks for store houses and sacks for his coming crops. The king is impressed and believes the boy is wealthy. He tests his noble origin by a bed-test (cf. Type 704). The boy is unable to sleep on the hard couch because he is worried about his lost pea. He marries the king’s daughter. When the king wants to see the property of his son-in-law, the young man meets an ogre (devil, grateful ghost) who offers to give him his castle, but only if he can solve some riddles. The ogre tells all the farmers and shepherds on the way to pretend to be employees of the poor boy. An old man helps him solve the riddles. The ogre and his brothers burst, and the poor man becomes the owner of the castle and its land. Cf. Type 859.

|550       Bird, Horse and Princess (previously Search for the Golden Bird). The type combines two different introductory episodes with a com mon main part. Introductory episodes: (1) Every night an unknown thief steals a golden apple [F813.1.1] from the king’s tree. The two elder princes fall asleep when they watch for the thief, but the youngest is successful. He sees a gold- en  bird  [B102.1]  and  shoots  one  of  its  colored  (golden)  feathers [H1471]. (2) A sick king can only be healed by the singing of a golden bird. He orders a search for it [H1210.1, H1331.1, H1213, H1331.1.2, H1331. 1.3]. Main part: The three brothers go on a quest for the golden bird. The first two meet a fox (wolf) which they intend to shoot. The fox warns them against going to a pleasant inn in the village, but they go there never theless. Both of them forget their father and the bird. The youngest son is kind to the fox, follows its advice, and finds

Against the fox’s advice he also takes its golden cage and thus wakes the guards. In order to save his life he has to go on a quest for a golden (magic) horse [B184. 1]. Again, he also takes its golden bridle, so its guards awake, and he is condemned to death unless he brings a golden maiden (prin- cess) [D961, N711.3, H1241, H1239.3]. With the fox’s help [B435.1] he succeeds and finally reaches home with the golden princess, the golden horse, and the golden bird [H1242]. Against the fox’s advice he releases his brothers from the gal lows. They steal the bird, the horse, and the princess, and try to kill the youngest brother [W154.12.3]. They pretend to their father that they have brought him the valuable things [K1932]. The fox saves the life of the youngest brother (by using water of life). The golden bird, the horse, and the princess identify him as the man who res cued them. (He marries the princess [L161]) and his brothers are punished.) In some variants the king is healed by the bird’s singing. Cf. Type 551. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 300, 301, 314, 531, 551, 780, and also 302, 303, 303A, 304, 329, 400, 461,  
505, 513, 516, 530, and 707. 
Remarks: This type occurs often in combination with Type 551, so many variants  
cannot be assigned to one or the other.

|551       Water of Life (previously The Sons on a Quest for a Wonderful Rem- edy for their Father). A sick king can only be healed by a wonderful remedy [H1324, D1500.1.18] (water of life [H1321.2], rejuvenating apples, phoenix bird [H1331.1], etc.). Whoever brings it [H1210.1] will inherit the kingdom. His three sons go on a quest. The two elder haughty ones are diverted from their goal. The youngest is single-minded and friendly towards old men (dwarf, eagle) who show him the way and give advice. With their help he reaches a magic castle that opens only for one hour. He appeases the animal guards (dragon, etc.) and finds everyone else asleep. He locates the fountain of life (golden apple tree) and takes the remedy [H1242]. He sleeps with a beautiful woman (princess) [N711.3, T475.2] and leaves his name (identification token) with her [H81.1]. When he leaves the castle it closes (sinks). On his way back he rejuvenates (releases) the helpful old men and receives magic objects in return. At home his unsuccessful brothers secretly exchange a common (poisoned) remedy for his healing one [K2211, W154.12.3]. They give it to the king [K1932] and he recovers. These brothers slander the youngest and the king orders him to be killed. With the help of his magic objects he is able to escape this sentence.

She ar- rives at the head of an army and demands the father of her son [H1381.2.1]. The haughty brothers pretend it is they. They accom pany her, riding beside the golden cloth (path) which the princess has spread, but they find that the gate at its end is closed. The young est brother appears in rags, rides down the middle of the golden cloth toward the castle (is recognized by his tokens), and the gate opens for him. He marries the woman [L161] and becomes the ruler of the kingdom. The old king learns what really happened.

|552       The Girls Who Married Animals. (Including the previous Types 552A and 552B.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Following the wish of his dead father and against his brothers’ advice, the youngest son marries his three sisters to the first suitors who come for them [S221.1]. The suitors take the girls home with them [B620.1, B640]. On a quest for his sisters, the brother reaches the castles of his brothers-in-law and learns that they are the masters of the three ani- mal kingdoms (men transformed to animals [D620, D621.1]; cf. Type 302C*). They receive their brother-in-law in a friendly way and provide him with magic means (parts of their body, feathers, hair, etc.) [B501, B505.1] to use to call them at any time (he leaves a signal of distress). With their help he accomplishes difficult tasks and finally marries a woman (princess). (He is dismembered by an ogre, summons the brothers-in-law, and they resuscitate him; cf. Type 302C*. They also recover his lost castle; cf. Type 560). (Previously Type 552A.) (2) Three girls who despair of being married say that they will marry anyone even if the suitors are animals [C26]. Three animals pass by and take along the three girls as wives. When the girls’ father  visits his daughters, he finds food and other things magically pro- vided by the brothers-in-law [D2105]. Later (at home) he tries the same method without success [J2411.3] (his effort nearly ends tragic- ally). (Previously Type 552B.) 

Combinations: 302, 302C*, 303A, 317, 400, 425A, 425C, 518, 554, and 560. 
Remarks: Important version see Basile, Pentamerone (IV,3). The type occurs in two  
forms, but many variants are not clearly differentiated. The second form occurs  
mainly in northern Europe and is less widespread.

|554       The  Grateful  Animals.  (Including  the  previous  Types  553,  554*, 554A*–C*, and 556A*–E*.) This miscellaneous type comprises vari- ous tales dealing with helpful deeds of grateful animals. In numer ous tales the type occurs only as episode. Most of the variants present the following basic structure: A man while travelling meets three animals (from air, water and earth) who are in trouble. Because he rescues them, they promise to help him if needed. Later he falls in love with a princess whose father sets three impossible tasks for him to accomplish. With the help of the grateful animals he succeeds on three successive days [B582.2, H982, B571] and wins the princess. In some variants a part is added in which the man accompanies his elder brothers. When they try to injure some animals, he pre vents them from doing so or compensates for their misdeeds and careless- ness. When they trample on an ant-hill, he builds it up again, when they leave wounded animals, he takes care of them, etc. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 300, 302, 400, 531, and also 303, 313, 314, 317, 329, 402, 465, 513A, 513B,

|555       The Fisherman and His Wife. A poor old fisherman rescues a super- natural being (magic fish [B170], other animal, divine being, saint, ogre, man in form of animal) from distress (danger of death, im- prisonment, transformation). Or the fisherman puts a fish back into the water [B375.1]. In return the magic being grants him (and his wife) that all his wishes will be fulfilled [D1761.0.1]. In the beginning they profit only moderately, but later the wife becomes excessively demanding (e.g. they wish to become noble men, kings, and finally even God himself). The fish (spirit) takes back his gift and the couple is returned to their former poor con dition or punished in addition [C773.1, J514, Q338, L420] (trans formed to animals).

|556F*     The Shepherd in the Service of a Witch. A father sends one of his three sons to tend the cattle (sheep, etc.) of a landlord who is a soothsayer (prince of sun, witch). When the boy drives the cattle to pasture, they suddenly disappear (in the forest, crossing a brook). He can- not follow them because he is confined in a tree (by a super natural woman ). After a while the cattle return, but he does not know where they have been or what they have eaten. Consequently he has not accomplished his task (and is punished). Then his brother tries, but he also loses the cattle. When the youngest brother tends the cattle, he succeeds with the help of the animals (the woman who had caught his brothers in the tree). By following the cattle, he learns that they transform themselves to women (daughters of the witch) during their absence. So he has accomplished his task [H1199.12.2].

|559       Dungbeetle. A (stupid, poor) boy (farmer’s son, smith, soldier, old man) buys various animals with special qualities (from a super- natural being): a mouse (rat), a (dung-) beetle, and a crayfish (ant, bee, cricket, louse, flea, lizard). Or he meets (finds) the animals on his way and takes them along. The king promises his melancholy daughter to any man who can make her laugh [T68, F591, H341, H1194]. The boy accomplishes this by means of the amusing actions of his animals (dancing, playing music) [H982, B571, B582.2]. But he is not accepted as a bridegroom and is thrown into a lion’s den. He is rescued by his animals, who also drive out the boy’s rival (prince) by their characteristic behav- iors: The dungbeetle carries away the prince’s excrement [B482.2], the mouse makes him sneeze, etc., or they torment him for three nights in such a way that he does not touch the princess but soils the bed instead. The king sends him away [T171] and the boy marries the princess [L161]. Cf. Types 571, 857.

|560          The Magic Ring. A boy buys a dog, a cat, and a snake in order to save them from death (he rescues a snake from burning). In return he receives a magic ring (stone) from the king of the snakes (father of the rescued snake) which will grant all wishes [D810, D812, D1470.1, D1470.1.15, D817.1, B360, B505, B421, B422] (he finds the ring [D840]). With his wishing ring [D1662.1] he builds a magic castle [D1131.1] and performs impossible tasks (building a castle, a bridge of glass, a church of wax, etc. in one night).    He marries the princess, who has a lover. The wishing ring is stolen  from him by the princess [D861.5, K2213] (by her lover [D861. 4], another person) who wishes herself and the castle (with the prin- cess) to be transported to a faraway island [D2136.2]. Her husband finds himself poor again. The grateful dog and cat swim to the castle  and recover the ring [D882, B548.1, D882.1.1] with the help of a mouse  [K431].    On their way back they lose the ring in the sea, but a fish (cray- fish) gives it back to them. Finally the boy recovers his ring, the castle and his wife. He punishes the lover (his faithless wife).

|561      Aladdin. A magician orders a (stupid) boy, Aladdin, to fetch a lamp for him out of a cave of treasures. The cave opens and closes by means of a magic ring [D1470.1.5]. Aladdin finds the lamp [D812.5, D840, D1470.1.16, D1421.1.5, D1662.2], but when he wants to leave the cave it does not open (the magician has closed it). When Aladdin rubs the magic ring (lamp) in despair, a helpful genie appears and leads him out. Aladdin reaches his mother’s house and wishes for riches and a castle [D1131.1]. Both wishes are fulfilled by the genie (by another spirit who appears in the same way when the lamp or the ring is rubbed). Aladdin woos the princess, but her father intends to marry her to another man (Aladdin marries the princess [L161]). The magician exchanges the old, magic lamp (which the princess had kept) for a new, worthless one [D860, D371.1]. He wishes him self to be transfered to Africa together with the princess and the castle [D2136.2]. Aladdin is imprisoned. He rubs the ring [D881] and the genie takes him to the castle where the princess is. She poisons the magician (Aladdin kills him). Aladdin takes the lamp again and uses it to return with the castle and the princess to his home. Cf. Types 560, 562.

|562       The Spirit in the Blue Light. A discharged soldier (deserter) is asked by an old woman (witch) to fetch for her a fire-steel (light, tinder- box, candle) from an underground treasury (magic castle) guarded by dogs [D845]. He keeps it for himself (kills the old woman). He discovers that when he lights the fire-steel a helpful spirit (dogs, iron man, giant) appears [D1470.1, D1421.1.2, D1421.1.4, N813]. He orders the spirit to bring the princess to him during three successive nights [D1426]. She has to serve him (he kisses her, impregnates her). The king tries to discover where his daughter goes by putting a mark on the door [R135]. The spirit discovers the ruse and defeats it by putting the same mark on all the houses. The third time the soldier takes the princess, he is discovered (gives up himself) and imprisoned. He asks for his fire-steel, and before he is executed he

When he lights his fire-steel, the spirit appears and rescues him (and imprisons the king instead) [K331, D1391]. By threatening violence the soldier forces the king to agree that he may marry his daughter. Cf. Types 560, 561.

|563       The Table, the Donkey and the Stick. A (poor) man receives from a supernatural being (God, devil, wind) a table that covers itself with food (tablecloth, etc.) [D1030.1, D1472.1.7, D1472.1.22]. On his way home he stays in an inn and others see him use the table (he forbids others to use it) [J2355.1]. The innkeeper cheats him by exchanging the magic table (cloth) with an ordinary one [D861.1, K2241, D861.3, D861.2]. After the poor man arrives home the table does not have any magic power, so he goes back to the giver and complains. The giver gives him a gold-dropping animal (donkey [B103.1.1], hen, etc.). The same thing happens again. This time the man receives a sack containing a magic cudgel [D1401.2] (mannikin) that beats people until it is called off by its owner [D1601.5, D1401.1, D1651.2]. The man himself is beaten by the cudgel. When the greedy innkeeper tries to steal the sack, the cudgel beats him until he returns all the stolen magic objects [D881.2]. Cf. Types 564, 565, and 569. 
Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 564, 569, and also 212, 313, 326, 461, 554, 555, 566, 1541, and 1960G. 
Remarks: Important versions see Basile, Pentamerone (I,1, cf. V,2). The variants of  
the Types 563, 564 and 565 are often mixed with each other or they are not clearly  
differentiated. Only the Grimms’ version (No. 36) is introduced by the tale of the  
lying goat, where three brothers set out on a journey (cf. Type 212).

|564       The Magic Providing Purse (previously The Magic Providing Purse  and “Out, Boy, out of the Sack!”). A supernatural being (devil, spir- its, fortune, frost, wind) gives a poor man an object (knapsack, sack, purse, pot, box) that supplies him with unlimited food. The man takes it home to his family. A rich man (brother, neighbor) buys (borrows, steals) the magic object, and soon the poor man is hungry again. He asks the super- natural being for a replacement and receives a similar looking object.  But this one produces men with cudgels (whips) instead of food; they beat him and his family. The poor man gives the object to his rich neighbor. He is beaten until he returns the food-supplying object to the poor man. In some variants the last scene occurs at a meal organized by the rich man and all his guests are beaten. Cf. Types 563, 565.

|565       The Magic Mill. A poor man receives a ham from his rich brother (the devil) who tells him to “go to the devil” with it. An old man directs him to the devil, where he exchanges his ham for a mill that grinds anything its owner wishes (meal, salt [D1601.21.1], other food; a pot that fills itself with porridge [D1601.10.1, D1472.1.9]). Only its owner can command it to stop [D1651, D1651.3]. The poor man becomes rich. Cf. Type 480C*. His envious brother buys (steals) the mill, but he does not know how to stop it. It grinds such a quantity of food (flour, herrings, porridge, etc.) that the man is overpowered (it fills the whole house with porridge [C916.3]). The real owner stops it and takes it back again. Often combined with the following episode: A ship-captain steals (buys) the mill and commands it to grind salt. He also cannot stop it, and it grinds so much salt that his ship finally sinks. The mill keeps grinding at the bottom of the sea, and this is why sea-water is salty [A1115.2]. Cf. Types 563, 564.

|566       The Three Magic Objects and the Wonderful Fruits. (Fortunatus.) (Including the previous Type 580*.) Three brothers (soldiers, a young man) each receive a magic object from a supernatural being (man- nikin, enchanted princess) [D812, N821, D1470.1]: a purse that fills itself [D1451], a coat or cap that takes its owner anywhere [D1520, D1520.11], a horn or whistle that furnishes soldiers or brings power [D1475.1]). The king notices the glamorous life-style of the owner of the purse. By a ruse (by playing cards [D861.6]) the princess steals the purse (magic objects). Its owner gets the magic objects of his brothers, and they are stolen as well. He eats magic fruits (apple, fig, nut, vegetables, magic drink) that cause and cure disfigurement (horns grow on the head, and are removed). He gives (sells) the princess the magic fruits and horns grow on her head [D992.1, D1375.1] (she grows a long nose [D1376.1], is transformed into a donkey [cf. Type 567]). He sells her the healing fruits only when she confesses her theft and promises to return his magic objects [D881.1, D895, D1375.2]. Cf. Type 567. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 518, 567, 569, and also 302, 306, 400, 560, 562, 563, 567A, and 735. 
Remarks: The variants of the Types 566, 567, and 567A are often mixed with each  
other or they are not clearly differentiated. (Type 567 may originate from a com- 
bination with Type 566.) Literary traditions first documented in the Middle Ages  
(e.g. Gesta Romanorum, No. 120). Popular German novel (1509).

|567       The Magic Bird-Heart. A man eats the heart of a magic bird and thereby receives the power of spitting gold [B113.1] (of finding a coin under his pillow every day, he becomes king [D1561.1.1, M312. 3]). A woman (his own wife) causes him to vomit the bird-heart, eats it herself (because she learned its secret from an old woman) [D861.5] and casts him out. He finds a magic herb that transforms people into donkies [D965, D983, D551.2, D132.1, D661]. With the help of the herb he changes the woman to donkey (and makes it work hard). Cf. Type 566. In some variants he changes the woman back to a human being and marries her. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 300, 303, 518, 531, 566, and 567A. 
Remarks: Probably of Oriental origin (see Ṭuṭi-Nāme and Somadeva’s Kathā saritsā- 
gara). The variants of the Types 566, 567, and 567A are often mixed with each other  
or they are not clearly differentiated. (Type 567 may originate from a combination  
with Type 566.) Often an introduction to Type 303.

|567A      The Magic Bird-Heart and the Separated Brothers. Two brothers condemned to death (whose stepmother claims they have insulted her [K2111, S322.4]) are spared [K512]. They eat parts of a magic bird (magic object, magic fruit, etc.) that will make one become a king, and the other produce gold (precious stones) when laughing (cry ing). (The magic bird is prepared as a meal for another person [by their mother] but the brothers eat it by mistake.) The brothers flee and are separated (when fetching water [N311]). The elder brother is chosen as king [N683] (with the help of a royal elephant [H171.1]). The younger brother is enslaved by a foreign king who forces him to produce gold (he falls into the hands of a shipowner who sacrifices him so that his becalmed ship may sail [S264.1]. He is cast overboard, arrives in a distant land, and wins a [several] brides). Finally the brothers are reunited and the younger brother is freed (the elder searches for his younger brother and finds him).

Remarks: The variants of the Types 566, 567, and 567A are often mixed with each  
other or they are not clearly differentiated. (Type 567 may originate from a combin-

|569       The Knapsack, the Hat and the Horn. The youngest of three poor brothers obtains a magic object [D840, D1470.1] (table-cloth, napkin, table, mill) that magically produces food [D1472.1.22]. On his way he exchanges the object for a knapsack that can produce an army [D1475.4] (magic weapon, stick, sabre, cudgel out of the sack). By means of this he secures the first object again [D831]. In the same way he gets other magic objects that function as weapons (hat), make walls fall down (horn [D1222]), provide him with unlimited quanti- ties of money, let him cover enormous distances (seven-league boots, flying carpet), produce a castle (etc.), or resuscitate the dead (violin, flute). Back home he lives a glamorous life. The magic objects are stolen from him by a cunning guest (king, princess, neighbor). By using the last object he recovers them all. With the help of the magic horn he destroys the attacking army and kills the king and his daughter; or, he resuscitates the people he has killed, makes peace with the king, marries the princess, and inherits (half of) the kingdom. In some variants the king is attacked by enemies. The boy res cues him from danger using his magic objects, and marries the prin cess. Cf. Type 465A.

|570       The Rabbit-Herd. A king offers his daughter in marriage to whoever can herd (catch, tame, train) his 100 (more or fewer) rabbits (roost- ers, sheep, goats, geese, partridges) without losing any [T68, H335, H1112]. The youngest of three brothers is kind to an old woman (to whom his brothers were unkind) and receives a magic whistle with which he can summon the rabbits [D1441.1.2]. In order to avoid the mar- riage, members (deputies) of the royal family (in disguise) try to buy one of his rabbits. The young man demands a degrading humil i ating act (e.g. jumping on one leg, dancing to the whistle, turning somer- saults, attaching a pot to his or her bottom, being beaten, cutting flesh out of his/her own body, branding his/her skin, tear ing an animal carcass with teeth, kissing the backside of an animal [K1288] or of a person, sodomy, eating excrement, kissing him or sleeping with him [K1358]). After the demands are fulfilled, the young man whistles and the rabbit comes back to him. Not willing to admit defeat, the king sets another task: the young man should fill a sack of lies (truths) [H1045]. When the king real- izes that the “lies” are actually truths that humiliate the royal family [K1271.1.1], he announces that the sack is filled up and agrees to the marriage.

|570A      The Princess and the Magic Shell. In his third catch of fish, a fisher man finds a golden dish (cup, shell, fish-skin) which, whenever some one drinks from it, fills itself with gold pieces. A princess (queen) wants the dish, and he agrees to give it to her if she will sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and is banished by her father (husband). She goes (with the fisherman, alone after he has been killed) to another country where she becomes wealthy (with the help of the vessel). She disguises herself as a man [K1837] and returns home. Her father wants to have the magic dish, and she says she will give it to him if he will sleep with her. He agrees. She reveals who she is and exposes his hypocrisy. They are reconciled.

|570*       The Rat-Catcher. (The Pied Piper of Hamelin.) A city has been over- run by rats and mice. A man dressed in odd, colorful clothing prom- ises the inhabitants that he will drive the vermin out in return for a fee. He lures the animals out by playing a flute and drowns them in a river. The citizens refuse to pay him (to keep their promise) and the piper goes away empty-handed. Later, he comes back disguised as a hunter. He plays his flute and all the children follow him out of the city. He leads them into a mountain, and they are never seen again [D1224, D1427.1, D1441. 1.2].

|571        “All Stick Together”. A melancholy princess is promised in mar- riage to whoever can make her laugh [F591, H341, H1194, T68]. The young est (most stupid) of three brothers (poor shepherd, son of a farmer or craftsman) receives a magic object (golden animal, ve hicle) [D817] from an old woman (man, supernatural being) because of his kindness (out of pity, through a lucky bargain). On his way (during an overnight stay) a curious person (thief) touches the object and cannot let it go (the young man makes the person stick to it by a magic formula or stick) [K422, D1413, D2171.3.1]. Later other (naked) people, objects, and animals become attached to the magic object or to each other [D2171.5]. This strange looking parade passes by the castle where the princess sees it and laughs for the first time in her life [H341.1]. The young man marries her (and gets half of the kingdom).

|571B      Lover Exposed (previously The Himphamp). (Including the previous Type 571A.) A man falls in love with the wife of a smith (crafts- man, farmer). In order to get rid of the husband he denounces him to the master (of the castle), pretending that the husband practices magic . The master thereupon orders him to perform (three) impossible tasks [H931, H1010], of which the last one is to make a “Himphamp” – a fictional word without any meaning. The husband gets help (from the devil [D812.3], supernatural being) to solve the tasks, the last one by a magic formula that makes things stick together. He surprises the loving couple in bed and makes them stick together (to the chamber pot [D1413.8]). Or, a man learns that his wife has commited adultery. By means of a magic sticking formula (magician) he makes the loving couple

Helpful servants get also stuck. The next day the man leads the chain of persons through the streets. Other people (farmhand, maidservant), animals (cow, bull) and objects (food) get stuck in obcene situations and are mocked by passers-by. The man presents his “Himphamp” to the master. All are released, and the guilty ones are punished, made to pay compen- sation, or pardoned. They promise to reform, they escape, or they drown themselves.

|571C       The Biting Doll. (Including the previous Type 560C*.) A kind girl (boy) receives a magic doll (goose) that defecates money [D1268, D1469.2]. An envious neighbor borrows the doll [D861.2], but it soils her house and she throws it out on the street. When the king, who has stopped to relieve himself, uses the doll to wipe himself, it bites his backside and sticks to him (bites him when he passes by). Nobody can remove the doll from the king’s body. He announces that any one who can release him will get a reward [H1196]. Only the girl is able to make the doll stop biting [D1651]. She recovers her doll and marries the king [T67.3.1].

|575       The Prince’s Wings. Rival workmen have a contest to construct the most wonderful object. A goldsmith builds an artificial fish (some- thing else), a joiner constructs an artificial flying object (fold ing wings, bird, mechanical horse with wings). A prince buys the flying object and flies with it in a foreign country in order to see the prin- cess (who is enclosed in a tower by the king) [K1346, F1021.1]. He becomes her lover, and impregnates her (is taken in the very act). When the king learns what has happened, he orders the prince (and his daughter) to be executed. The lovers escape by riding together on the flying object to the prince’s home country [R111.3.1, R215.1], where they marry. In some variants they land on their way so the princess can give birth. When fetching fire the flying object is burned. The lovers are separated (and later reunited).

|580       Beloved of Women. At their father’s death three brothers are each granted a wish: the two elder ones wish for riches, but the youngest wishes for the power to make women love him [D1900]. They set out on a journey and spend the night in three different inns. The youngest brother sleeps with the wife (daughter) of the house and receives three magic objects [D856]: a tablecloth on which food magically appears, a rooster (similar) that produces drinks, and a pair of scissors that produces clothes out of nothing. The brothers reach a town where all who enter must be castrated. The youngest refuses and is taken as a prisoner to an island. With the help of his magic objects he secures a comfortable life for himself and the other prisoners. A princess (king’s widow) wants to buy the objects. The boy is only willing to give them to her if he may spend the night in her chamber, beside her, and finally in her bed [T45]. At the end he marries her.

|590       The Faithless Mother (previously The Prince and the Arm Bands). A boy sets out on a journey with his mother. On their way he finds an object (armband, belt, sword, shirt, etc.) which gives him super- natural strength [D840, D1335.5, D1335.4]. In a house of robbers (giants, other supernatural beings) the son defeats all of them (cf. Type 650A) until only one is left with whom his mother (secretly) starts a liaison [S12.1] (she marries him). In order to get rid of the son (the lover fears the son’s strength) the mother feigns sickness and sends her son on a dangerous quest for a remedy [H931, H1211, H1212] (fruit [apple] from the garden of supernatural beings [H1333.3.1, H1333.3.1.1, H1333.3.1.3, D1364. 4.1], water of life, animal’s milk [H1361]) for which he must risk his life. The son returns successful and uninjured [F615, F615.2.1], ac- com panied by wild animals that have become his protectors [B315, B431.2, B520]. In numerous variants the boy rescues a young girl (princess [R111.1.1]) during one of his adventures and sends (brings) her back to her father, and/or he meets female helpers (old woman, a girl skilled in magic, his bride). The boy’s mother asks him for the secret of his strength and steals it (ties him, gives him a narcotic drink, persuades him to take a bath) [K975, D861]. Then she (and/or her lover) blinds (murders) the boy. When he is blinded he is found by the princess, who nurses and restores his sight by observing how a blind animal is healed [B512]. When he is murdered he is resuscitated by one of his female helpers (using the remedies he procured). He recovers the object that holds his strength [D880] and takes revenge on his mother and her lover (kills them). He marries the princess (female helper, daughter of the helper). Cf. Type 315.

|592       The Dance among Thorns. A poor boy, driven from home by his evil stepmother [S322.4] (dismissed from service with a pittance [W154. 1]), gives all his money as alms to a beggar (supernatural being) [Q42.1] who in return grants the boy three wishes [D1761.0.2]: a never failing gun [D1653.1.7] (crossbow [D1653.1.4]), a fiddle (flute) that compels people to dance [D1415.2.5], another magic object or the magic power of having his wishes obeyed [D1761.0.1]. He shoots a bird (on a wager [N55, N55.1]), which falls into a thornbush. When a monk (Jew, the loser of the wager) tries to take the bird out, the boy’s magic fiddle makes him dance in the thorns. The boy is condemned and led to the gallows. He asks for per- mis sion to play his fiddle for the last time. The judge and whole assembly have to dance until the boy is released [K551.3.1].

The rejected suitor receives from a per- son skilled in magic (old woman [N825.3], witch, priest, devil) a magic  stone, which, when put into ashes, makes all people who use it (farmer, farmwife, farmhand, maidservant, preacher, daughter, etc.) stick to the poker and compells them to keep talking nonsense (e.g. “Fiddevav”) [D1413, D1413.17, D2172.1], (or, a magic root under the doorstep causes them fart). Only the suitor is able to release the people from the charm by taking the magic object away. In return he marries the young woman. Cf. Types 330A, 571, and 571B.

|610      The Healing Fruits. A sick princess is offered to whoever can cure her (with fruit) [T68.1, H346]. The youngest of three brothers suc- ceeds [Q2, L10, L13]. He is kind to a little man (old woman, grateful animals), who gives him the healing fruit [N825.3, D1500.1.5], after his elder brothers had reacted with annoyance at the little man’s questions. Before the marriage takes place, the king gives the youngest brother  impossible tasks. The little man helps him again. He has to

Type 570), and to fetch a feather from a magic bird (cf. Type 461). He performs the tasks, makes a fortune, returns, humbles the king, and marries the princess [L161]. Or, the king copies him in order to gain the same riches. On the way across a lake the ferryman drops him into the water and he is drowned. The young suitor gains his kingdom and marries the princess. Cf. Type 551.

|611       The Gifts of the Demons (previously The Gifts of the Dwarfs). The son of a merchant is betrothed to the daughter of another merchant (the adoptive son of a merchant falls in love with the merchant’s daughter). When the boy’s father dies, the girl’s parents change their minds and send the boy to sea to get rid of him. The ship sinks but the boy saves himself (on an island). He res- cues a child (from a lion, wolf, eagle, dragon, bad man) and receives a magic remedy (magic salve [D1500.1.19], healing water) as reward [D817.1] from demoniac women (dwarfs [F451.5.1], trolls, giants) with which he heals a sick princess (king), and a magic sword (spec- tacles, binoculars, flute, whistle, bone, gun) with which he overcomes a hostile army [D1400.1.4.1]. He returns home a rich man and marries the bride who had been promised to him in childhood (his first love [T102]).

|612       The Three Snake-Leaves. (Including the previous Types 465A* and 612A.) A man promises his wife (bride) that if she dies before him he will be buried with her [M254, S123.2] (to keep watch at her grave ). She soon (after the wedding) dies. In the grave (at the grave-side) he sees a snake (weasel) revive another dead snake with a herb (three leaves, blade of grass) [B512, B491.1, D1500.1.4]. He revives his wife in the same manner [E165]. His wife then falls in love with another man (ship’s captain) [K2213.5] and, together with her new lover, she throws her husband into the sea [K2213.2, S142]. Or, she leaves her husband and by a ruse causes him to be con- demned to death (as a thief). A faithful servant [P361] (friend, his mother) resuscitates him with the snake-leaves [E105]. The guilty pair is exposed and punished [Q261]. In some Indian variants, a god permits a man to resuscitate his wife by giving her half of his own lifespan. She falls in love with another man and tries to kill her husband. He is rescued and asks his wife to return the given years he gave her. She dies for a second time. (Previously Type 612A.)

|613       The Two Travelers. (Truth and Falsehood.) (Including the previous Types 613*, 613A*, and 613B*.) Two men (travelers, brothers, tailor and cobbler) argue (wager) [N61] about whether truth or falsehood (justice or unjustice, whose religion) is more powerful. They  call  on  animals  and  people  they  meet  to  act  as  judges [K451.1, N92]. The loser (the one who stands for the truth) is robbed and blinded, or the wicked man shares his bread with his hungry companion only if he will let his eyes be put out [M225, N2.3.3, S165]. The blind man spends the night in (under) a tree [F1045], where he overhears secrets of birds (other animals, devils, ogres, witches) [B253, G661.1, N451.1, N452]. By means of this knowledge [H963] he is able to restore his sight [D1505.5], to cure sickness (of the prin- cess, king) [C940.1, D2064.1, V34.2], to end drought [F933.2, H1193, N452.1], etc. [N552.1.1, D2101, H1181]. He is rewarded (marries the princess [H346]). His companion, intending to acquire the same wealth, imitates him. He goes to the same tree (sometimes also blinded), but the birds (devils) think it was he who betrayed their secrets, and tear him to pieces [N471].

|650A      Strong John. A young man, born of an animal (son of a bear) or from a giant (troll-woman, forged from iron by a smith) [B631, F611.1.1, F611.1.11–F611.1.15, T516] develops great strength (at the forge, in the forest, in war, by suckling for many years [F611.2.1, F611.2.3], by his great appetite, by tests of strength [F611.3.1], etc.). Because of his enormous appetite he is sent away from home [F612.1, F614.1]. He works for a smith but (often) injures his master [K1411, K1421, K1422], who tries to get rid of him by setting trials of strength [H931, F514.2, F612.3.1, F614.6]. The strong man has to up- root trees, to catch wolves and bears (lions, etc.), to tame devils, etc. [F613–F613.4]. When he is sent to catch wild animals [F615.2.3], he harnesses them to a coach. When he is in a well and a mill stone (bell) is thrown on him, he wears it as collar or complains that chickens are scratching dirt onto him [F615.3.1, F615.3.1.1]. When he is sent to the devil’s mill (hell), he drives the devil to his master’s house [F80, F615.1, H1272]. When he goes to the king to be paid, the king shoots him (in vain) with cannons. The strong man accom plishes every task and overcomes all difficulties [F615] (kills his master and finally marries).

|650B       The Quest for a Strong Companion. A young man seeks a strong adversary to wrestle with. He stays overnight in a hut where two strong men live. When he discovers them, he secretly runs away. In his flight he meets a giant plowman and begs him to conceal him from the strong men in pursuit. The giant plowman hides the young man in his trousers (pocket) [F531.5.11], and fights the two men [J2631].

|652       The Prince Whose Wishes Always Come True. A godfather (God, Christ, beggar, soldier, Virgin Mary, etc.) gives a prince the power to make all his wishes come true [N811, D1761.0.1]. An envious per- son (servant, gardener, cook, smith, general, dwarf, court jester, etc. [K2250]) learns about the prince’s extraordinary ability, and kidnaps the boy. The servant smears blood on the queen’s mouth [K2155.1] (clothes), so she is accused of killing and eating her son, and is im- prisoned [Q455]. The prince is rescued and reared by foster-parents (woodsman [R131.8.5, N856.1]). The kidnapper uses the prince’s magic power by telling him to wish for riches (castle). Later the prince falls in love with his foster-parents’ daughter (a playmate he had wished for [T52.1]), who tells him of his true iden- tity. The prince transforms his kidnapper into a dog [D141] and his sweetheart into a carnation [D212.1] (lily, rose) and goes with them to his father’s court where he takes service as a huntsman. He iden- tifies himself to his father. The queen is released and the male factor is punished. The prince restores his sweetheart to human form and marries her [D630, D711.4, H151.7, L162, S451].

|653       The Four Skillful Brothers. (Including the previous Type 513C*.) Three (four [P251.6.2] or more) brothers leave home and acquire extraordinary skills [F660.1]. The first is a huntsman, the second a ship-builder (astronomer), the third a thief (the fourth a tailor). When they return home they demonstrate their skills to their father [F642, F642.1, F661.1.1, F661.4, F662.1, H504, H1151.12, K305.1]. They all help to rescue a princess who was captured by a dragon [R166, R111.1.3]: The ship-builder builds a fast ship to carry them to the island where the princess is imprisoned (the astronomer dis- covers the place of her imprisonment), the thief steals her, and the huntsman shoots the dragon (the tailor sews the ship destroyed by the dragon back together [F662.2]). Later each of the brothers claims that he should marry the princess [H621.2, R111.7]. In some variants either their dispute remains unresolved [Z16], or the brothers’ father marries the princess. She may decide herself whom to marry. Sometimes it is proposed that she should be divided, and only her true lover objects (Solomon’s judgment, cf. Type 926). Or, the winning suitor is decided by lot, or the brothers are given money or half the kingdom instead [Q112].

|653A      The Rarest Thing in the World. A princess is offered to whichever of three suitors (friends, brothers) brings the best (rarest, most pre cious) thing in the world [T68.1] (three men with extraordinary abilities woo the princess). They acquire wonderful (magic) objects: a mirror (tele- scope, spectacles) which shows everything that is happening in the world [D1323.15], a flying coat (flying carpet) [D1520.18, D1520.19] and a fruit (apple, lemon, etc.) or an ointment that heals (resuscitates) [D1500.1.5.1, E106]. When they meet they use the telescope to see that the princess is sick (dead). They go to her immediately with the carpet and use the fruit to heal her (restore her to life). A dispute follows as to who is to marry her [H621.2, Z16]. (She chooses the one who loves her most.)

|653B      The Suitors Restore the Maiden to Life. A woman loved by three (four) suitors dies [T92.0.1]. The first keeps watch at her funeral pyre, the second takes her ashes to the river (Ganges), the third (a wander- ing beggar) learns a magic formula that restores her to life [T92.14]. A dispute follows as to who is to marry her [H621.2, Z16]. Usually  the  problem  is  solved  in  a  philosophic  explanation: The one who brought the woman back to life is like her father; the one who carried her ashes to the river is like her son; the one who watched  the funeral pyre is like her husband and therefore may marry her.

|654       The Three Agile Brothers. Three brothers are sent out by their father to acquire skills. The one who learns best will inherit the house [F660.1, H504]. The first becomes a smith, the second a barber, the third a fencer. When they are asked to demonstrate their skills, the smith shoes a horse while it is galloping [F663.1], the barber shaves a running hare [F665.1], the fencer circulates his sword so fast that he stays dry in a heavy rain [F667.1]. The father either chooses one of his sons, or, he leaves his prop- erty to all three of them.

|655       The Wise Brothers. (Including the previous Type 655A.) A father leaves  his wealth to his three sons. One of them steals diamonds (pieces of gold) that had been willed to all three brothers. In order to settle the case they consult a wise man. On their way they see tracks of an animal and make the following deductions [J1661.1]: It was a camel (horse, pack-animal), it was one-eyed (grass is eaten on one side of the road only) [J1661.1.1], it was lame (because of its tracks), it was carrying oil or honey, etc. (drops are seen on the ground), it had no tail (dung on a heap instead of being spread by the tail), etc. When they meet the owner of the lost animal he overhears their remarks, takes them for thieves, and brings them to the judge. They explain their observations to the judge and are absolved. When they are invited for dinner (by the judge) they say the meat is dogmeat [F647.5.1], the wine (bread) smells like a corpse [F647.1], and their host is a bastard [J1661.1.2]. On investigation all their statements are found to be true. The animal had been suckled by a bitch, the vine (corn) had grown on a cemetery, and the mother (of the judge) confesses her adultery. In some variants the judge tells the story of the noblest act (cf. Type 976) in order to settle the dispute of the inheritance. Based on his reaction he declares the youngest to be the thief. Or, the brothers are asked to shoot on their father’s corpse, so that their behavior discloses the real son and heir (cf. Type 920C). In other versions the judge enforces another test of paternity [H486.1], or he pronounces another of Solomon’s judgments.

Remarks: Indian variants e.g. in Bṛhatkathā of Kṣemendra and in Kathāsaritsāgara

|660       The Three Doctors. Three doctors display their skills [H504]. One removes one of his eyes, the second one his hand (arm, finger) and the third his stomach (heart), intending to replace it later [F668.1]. During the night a cat eats the body parts. A servant substitutes the eye of a cat [E781.3], the hand of a thief [E782.1.1] and the stomach of a hog [E787] (heart [E786]), and the doctors replace them without injury [E780.2, E782]. The one with the cat’s eye can see best at night (always looks for mice), the one with the thief’s hand steals, and the one with the hog’s stomach is always hungry (sniffs and roots at the ground).

|664*      The Soldier Hypnotizes the Innkeeper. (Including the previous Types 664A* and 664B*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A soldier (passer-by) in an inn pays with pieces of gold that turn out to be buttons (small bones). When the innkeeper takes the soldier to court, the soldier hypnotizes the judge so that he thinks a flood is occuring. He is forced to go through a series of adventures without leaving the room. Returning to his senses, the judge acquits the soldier. (Previously Type 664A*.) (2) A soldier tells tales and by his magic power makes an inn- keeper believe that he is a bear, that the soldier is a wolf, and that they are being chased by dogs, etc. The innkeeper falls out of his bed and comes to his senses. (Previously Type 664B*.)

|665       The Man Who Flew like a Bird and Swam like a Fish. A man (youngest  of three brothers, cheated heir) is given the power of transforming himself into animals of earth, air, and water [D630, D150, D170, D117.2] by an old man in return for his hospitality (con struction of a bridge) [E341] or by grateful animals [B350] whom he had helped [Q42.1].    He goes into the service of a king who has departed for war and has forgotten an (two) important object (magic sword [D1081], magic  ring [D1470.1.15], telescope, war documents, gloves). The king promises his daughter to whoever can deliver the forgotten object immediately.    The soldier offers his help. He reaches the castle fast by swim ming as a fish, flying as a bird, and running as a hare [D641]. He presents himself to the princess in his different transformations. She gives him the forgotten object and keeps a piece of his scale, pelt, a bit of fur, and a feather for herself.    On his return the soldier is killed by an envious rival [K1931.3]. The murderer takes the forgotten object and claims the reward. When the princess asks to see a second demonstration of the trans- formations, the cheater fails. She refuses to marry him and her father threatens to execute her.    The soldier, resuscitated by his magic helpers [B515], arrives at the last moment [N681], proves his identity (identification by feather [H78.2] and marries the princess. The cheater is condemned  to death .

A grateful snake gives a man the power to under- stand animal languages [B350, B491.1, B165.1, B216], and tells him that if he reveals the secret, he must die [C425]. Once the man hears animals talking and laughs. His curious wife insists on knowing why he does so [N456]. Worn down by her nag- ging, he is about to give in and tell her [T253.1]. Then he hears a rooster say how easily he rules his many wives, while the man cannot rule even his one wife [N451, B469.5, T252.2]. The man keeps his secret and does not tell her anything. Cf.

|670A      The Woman Who Understands Animal Languages. A newly married woman who knows animal languages hears jackals (other animals) saying that a corpse floating in the river has a valuable ring on its finger [N547]. She pulls the corpse from the river and removes the ring. (In order to remove the ring she has to bite off the finger. Her husband sees her, believes her to be a cannibal ogress [N342.6], and decides to return her to her family.) En route she overhears animals (birds) talking about where a treasure is hidden. Her husband learns the truth and they are recon- ciled. (The husband stays to guard the treasure and the wife goes to get her father-in-law. When he sees her returning alone, he con cludes she has killed his son and is returning to kill him, and slays her before she has a chance to speak.) Cf. Types 178A–178C.

|671       The Three Languages. A young man learns the languages of dogs [B215.2], birds [B215.1], and frogs [B215.4]. His father, angry at such useless knowledge, drives him out and orders him to be killed. A compassionate servant lets him escape and substitutes an animal’s heart as proof for the murder [K512.2]. By means of his knowledge of the dogs’ language the boy dis- covers a treasure (he cures a sick princess and marries her later). Through his knowledge of the frogs’ language he learns that he will be elected pope [H171.2]. When he arrives in Rome, two doves come to sit on his shoulders and he is recognized as a man worthy of being pope (birds indicate his election as pope [H171.2]). The two doves tell him what to do so that he will be elected pope, and give him advice on how to act. Cf. Types 517, 725. 

Remarks: Often combined with the Types 517 and/or 725. BP call the Types 517,  
671, and 725 “three forms” of one tale. Delarue/Tenèze call the three types a  
“cycle de la prédiction réalisée”. Oriental origin (Seven Wise Men). Documented

|672C*     Testimony of the Serpent. (Including the previous Type 842B*.) A woman who owns (is friendly with) a magic serpent is raped by a prince. The woman asks the serpent, who witnessed the act of vio- lence, to testify that the prince should marry no one else. (A prince calls a serpent to witness that he will marry a farmwife.) When the prince is about to marry a beautiful princess, the serpent twists itself about his neck. The first woman comes and frees him from the serpent on the condition that he marries her. (The serpent appears at the prince’s wedding, twists itself about his neck, and unwinds itself only when he will marry the farmwife.)

|673       The White Serpent’s Flesh. (Including the previous Types 671C* and 672D*.) Contrary to a warning, a servant (cook) eats the flesh of a white serpent (from the king’s pot), whereupon he understands the speech of animals (birds) [B217.1.1] (cf. Types 670, 672 [1]). Or, a boy (driver) tastes the meat of a white snake that has been prepared by a healer (farmer), whereupon he understands the lan- guage of the grass and trees. (Previously Type 672D*.) When he is accused of stealing a ring this knowledge enables him to prove his innocence. By overhearing the conversation of ducks he learns that one of them has swallowed the queen’s ring that fell from the window [N451]. (Previously Type 671C*.) He orders the duck to be slaughtered, the ring is found, and he is saved. (He learns that the ring is in the stomach of a grateful fish, who brings it back [cf. Type 736A].)

|675       The Lazy Boy. (Including the previous Type 675*). A lazy stupid boy [L114.1] releases a fish (frog, serpent, supernatural being), which gives him the power of making all his wishes come true [B375.1, D1761.0.1]. The lazy boy then makes an axe cut trees itself [D1601], water carry itself, a wagon move itself [D1523.1], an oven carry him, etc. When the princess laughs at him, he wishes her pregnant [T513] (from eating an apple, etc.). She does not know the father of her beautiful child. The king orders a test of paternity [H486], and the child picks the lazy boy out as father [H481] (by handing him an apple [H481.1], ball, golden ball). The king orders father and mother (and child) to be abandoned in a cask in the sea [S141] (in the mountains [S147]). By the power of wishing they reach land. The young man wishes to be beautified and makes a castle appear next to the king’s [D1131.1]. When the king comes to visit, the young man wishes that an object (golden apple, golden cup) would appear in his pocket [L175]. The king is accused of stealing. Thus he is shown that the appearance of guilt and inno- cence (unwitting pregnancy, unwitting theft) is often de ceptive.

|677       Iron is More Precious than Gold. An unlucky man asks his king for advice about what he should do. The princess advises him to marry because the luck of his wife (children) could counteract his own bad luck. The king allows him to marry the princess. When she sends him out to sell her needlework, he trades it for (threefold) pieces of good advice. He does not dare to return home without any money and finds work on a ship. When the ship is becalmed, he is sent down to the bottom of the sea to repair it, and there he settles a quarrel between two spirits: What is more precious (more useful, harder): gold (diamond, silver, copper) or iron (steel, copper)? He gives a (diplomatic) answer (following the first good advice). He receives a bag of (precious) stones as a reward and re- turns to the ship. Together with the merchants he reaches a strange country where the king favors him because of his jewels. The merchants are jealous

Following the sec ond advice, he wins the wager and with it all the servants and the ship. He continues to travel and trades for 7–30 years. Finally he returns home and finds his wife sleeping between two strange men. When he is about to kill all three, he remembers the third piece of advice, to think before he acts. He finds that the men are his two grown-up sons. Cf. Type 910B.

They have a boy (by supernatural birth) the size of a thumb [F535.1]. Thumbling takes food to his father on the farm and drives the wagon (plow) by sitting in the horse’s (ox’s) ear [F535.1.1.1]. He allows himself to be sold to strangers and then runs away from them. He lets himself be sold to thieves and accompanies them while they steal.

|704        Princess on the Pea. A prince wants to marry a true princess, but he cannot find one. One evening a young woman arrives at his palace pretending to be a true princess. The queen tests her by putting a pea under 20 (more or fewer) mattresses in her bed [H41.1]. The next morning the woman complains that she has slept badly because of something hard in her bed.

|705A       Born from Fruit (Fish). A husband becomes pregnant [T578] by eat- ing a magic fruit (fish) [T511.5.1] meant for his barren wife. He gives birth (from his knee [T541.16]) to a girl. The girl is abandoned and a bird rears her in a tree [R13.3]. A prince notices the reflected image of the (mute) girl in the water and falls in love with her. An old woman lures the girl down from the tree and she is captured and forced to marry the prince [N711]. The prince’s mother mutilates his wife during his absence and chases her away [S410]. The girl is given supernatural help. The prince’s mother disguises herself as his wife and they have sexual intercourse. The mother becomes pregnant and asks the ser- vants to bring a special fruit. While looking for the fruit they hear a verse that reveals the truth, and they become mute. The prince himself looks for the fruit, learns the truth and is reunited with his wife. His mother is punished. Cf. Types 300A, 303, and 705B.

|705B      Born from Knee. A man gives birth [T578] from his knee [T541.16] to several children. He puts them up in a tree and advises them not to lower the rope. A giant (wolf, other being) induces a child to lower the rope. The giant climbs up the tree and devours the children. When the father returns and realizes what has happened he fights with the giant and opens its belly (toe). All the children come out and become the ancestors of the various ethnic groups. Cf.

|706       The Maiden without Hands. (Including the previous Type 706A.) A girl has her hands cut off [Q451.1, S11.1] because she refuses to mar- ry her father [S322.1.2] (because her father has sold her to the devil [S211], forbids her to pray, her sister-in-law has slandered her to her brother). She is exposed in the forest and eats fruit from a garden.

She gives birth but is cast out along with her children, because her parents-in-law (father, mother, sister-in-law, devil) alter a letter from the king [K2117, K2110.1]. During  her  second  banishment  her  hands  grow  back  again [E782.1], usually restored by water (river, well, sea water), often with supernatural help (angel, saint, Virgin Mary, God). She is reunited with her husband [H57.5, S451]. Cf. Types 706C, 712.

|706B      The Chaste Nun (previously Present to the Lover). This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A young woman of noble birth (nun) mutilates herself (by cutting off her eyes, hands, breasts, hair) to prevent the persecutions of a lover. She sends her eyes which he had admired, to her lecher ous lover (brother, nobleman, bishop) [T327.1]. (2) A man (priest) is tempted by the devil. He mutilates himself in order to keep his chastity (not to be tempted by the beauty of a [adopted] girl) [T333.3].

|706D       St. Wilgefortis and Her Beard. A pagan king promises his daughter (Wilgefortis, Liberta, Ontkommer, Kümmernis), who is a Christian, in marriage to another pagan king who has conquered his country. The daughter wants only to become a bride of the crucified Christ. In order to evade the forced marriage she prays to God to alter her appearance (cf. Type 706B), and suddenly she grows a beard. Her angry father has her nailed to a cross, so that she will be like her beloved. As she dies, she prays for all who suffer pain or sorrow. Her father’s palace burns down. In some versions (The Shoe of St. Anthony) an old musician (fid- dler) plays for the crucified woman before she dies. She (her picture) thanks him by giving him her gold (silver) shoe (ring) [D1622.3]. The shoe is discovered in the possession of the musician, who is condemned as a thief. On his way to the gallows he asks to be allowed to play again in the collonade of the church. As soon as he begins to play, the holy picture of the crucified woman drops the other shoe for him, thus proving his innocence. 

Remarks: Documented in the Netherlands at the end of the 14th century. The  
musician’s miracle first appeared ca. 1200 in Tumbeor Nostre Dame.

|707        The Three Golden Children (previously The Three Golden Sons). Three girls boast that if they marry the king [N201] they will have triplets with golden hair [H71.2, H71.3], a chain around the neck [H71.7], and a star on the forehead [H71.1]. The king overhears the youngest and marries her [L162, N455.4]. When she gives birth to three marvelous children the elder sis- ters substitute animals (dogs) [K2115]. She is imprisoned (banished) [K2110.1, S410], her children are exposed [S142, S301] but are res cued by a miller [R131.2] (fisherman [R131.4]). When they have grown up, the eldest son sets out to find his father  [H1381.2.2.1], to seek a speaking bird [H1331.1.1], a singing tree  [H1333.1.1],  or  the  water  of  life  [H1320,  H1321.1,  H1321.4, H1321.5]. He and his brother both fail and are transformed to marble columns [D231.2]. The sister, with the help of an old woman [N825. 3], succeeds in rescuing them [R158] and in bringing back the magic objects. The attention of the king is drawn to the children and the magic objects [H151.1]. The bird of truth reveals the whole story [B131.2, K1911.3.1]. The children and their mother are restored; the sisters are punished [Q261, S451].

|709         Snow White. Snow White has a skin white as snow and lips red as blood [Z65.1]. A magic mirror tells her stepmother that Snow White  is more beautiful than she [D1323.1, D1311.2, L55, M312.4]. The jealous stepmother orders a hunter to kill Snow White [S322.2],  but he substitutes an animal’s heart and saves her [K512.2].   Snow White goes to a house of dwarfs (robbers) [N831.1] who adopt Snow White as their sister [F451.5.1.2]. The stepmother now attempts to kill her by means of poisoned lace [D1364.16, S111.2], a poisoned comb [D1364.9, S111.3] and a poisoned apple [D1364.4.1, S111.4]. The dwarfs succeed in reviving the maiden from the first two poisonings but fail with the third. They lay her in a glass coffin [F852.1].   A prince resuscitates her and marries her [E21.1, E21.3]. The step- mother is made to dance herself to death in red hot shoes [Q414.4].

|709A       The Sister of Nine Brothers (previously The Stork’s Daughter). A girl goes into the forest to search for her nine brothers and stays with them (an abandoned child is reared in the forest by two storks [S352]). After they leave their sister in a tree, her fire goes out. Search- ing for fire, she is finally given some by an ogress. Later the ogress follows the ashes that the girl has dropped [J1146] and tries to kill her. The girl steps on poisoned nails (tooth, bone) left by the ogress and dies. Her brothers (storks) put her in a glass case. When a prince removes the nails (tooth, bone), the girl is resuscitated and marries the prince.

|710       Our Lady’s Child. A father (unwittingly) promises his daughter to a supernatural figure [S211, S240, S242]. The Virgin Mary (Christ, saint) or a black woman (wicked stepmother, witch, sorcerer) takes  the child into heaven (church, castle) or away in a black coach [V271]. The girl looks into a forbidden room [C611], where she sees God (Christ, Virgin Mary), and her hair and finger become golden [C911]. Or, she sees enchanted men (black virgins, skeletons). The girl obstin- ately denies what she has seen, is struck dumb [J213, Q451.3, C944] and banished into the wilderness. She marries a king [N711.1] and gives birth to three children. The Virgin Mary (foster-mother, stepmother, mother-in-law) takes away her children [G261] and the queen is accused of in fanticide [K2116.1.1]. When she is to be burned to death on the stake, the queen finally acknowledges her guilt [H13.2, D2025.1, H215] (by keeping silence she delivers the black woman). She is rescued from death and from her dumbness and her children are given back to her.

|715       Demi-cock. Demi-cock (half-chick) [B171.1] leaves home in order to claim back a borrowed (stolen) object (money). On his way he meets animals (fox, wolf) and a river. He takes them along by swal- lowing them (carries them under his wings) [B435.1, F601.7, D915.2, F601.7]. When claiming the money from his debtor, Demi-cock is im- prisoned with animals who try to kill him. Fox and wolf eat the attacking animals, and when Demi-cock is thrown into a fire, the river extinguishes it [D1382.8]. Finally Demi-cock obtains the money [K481] by swallowing. At home he is beaten by his owner (king) and expells the money (he is eaten by his owner and crows from his stomach [B171.1.1]). Cf. Type 715A.

|715A      The Wonderful Rooster. An old couple (old man, old woman) have a rooster and a hen. The rooster lays no eggs and is driven away. He mocks the king and is sentenced to be drowned, but instead drinks all the water. He is supposed to be roasted but extinguishes the fire with the water he has drunk. He is locked in the treasury and swal- lows all the money. Back home he defecates the money [B103.1] onto a sheet (for the old man). (The old woman sends her hen to do the same, but the animal only produces dung instead of money.)

|725       Prophecy of Future Sovereignty (previously The Dream). A clever boy refuses to tell his dream (about his future sovereignty) [M312. 0.1, D1812.3.3] to his father and to the king. He is punished and endures various adventures (imprisonment) [L425]. A princess nourishes him in prison. War is to be declared on the emperor if he is not able to solve two riddles and a task. The clever boy solves the riddles and the task, tells the answers to the princess, and is freed from prison. So the boy averts war, marries the princess [H551], and finally receives two kingdoms.

|735A      Bad Luck Imprisoned. (Including the previous Type 332F*.) A poor brother leaves home to find better luck in another place, but his personified bad luck (poverty) [N112] wants to go with him. On a pretext the man locks up the bad luck in a bottle (bag, chest) [N112.1] or buries (drowns) it (and from then on lives happily [previously Type 332F*]). When his rich brother frees the bad luck out of jealousy, it at taches itself to him because it is afraid of the clever poor brother. Cf. Types 507, 735, 736, 947, and 947A.

|736       Luck and Wealth. A rich and a poor friend make a wager: Does wealth come from hard work or from good luck? In order to test their theor- ies, the rich man gives money to a poor craftsman. The first time the money is stolen by a bird, the second time his wife spends it. The poor man gives the craftsman a piece of lead which a fisher- man uses as weight for his net. He receives from him the first fish he catches and in its body he finds a jewel [N421]. This proves that fortune is more powerful. When the poor man recovers his luck, the lost money which was given to him by the rich man is often found in a nest or in a jug. Cf. Types 745, 745A, 945, and 945A*.

|736A      The  Ring  of  Polycrates.  This  tale  exists  chiefly  in  two  different forms: (1) When King Amasis learns about the military success of Poly- crates he advises him not to provoke the jealousy of the gods. As sign of his humility he should throw away the thing he likes most. Thereupon Polycrates throws his most precious ring into the sea. Some days later a fish is given to him in which the ring is found [N211.1]. (2) Because she is haughty (annoyed at a beggar) a rich woman (landlord, businessman) throws her ring into the sea (river, lake) saying, “As improbable as it is that I will see this ring again, so improbable it is that I will ever become poor”. The ring is returned to her and a short time later she becomes poor. Cf. Types 745, 745A, 836, 930A, and 933.

|737       Who Will be Her Future Husband? On New Year’s Eve (Christmas Eve) a young woman foresees her future husband [D1825.1], a sol- dier.

|745A      The Predestined Treasure. A miser finds money (treasure), but a voice tells him that it is predestined for someone else. The miser hides it in a hollow tree and throws it into the sea (loses it in a flood). A fisherman finds the treasure and gives it to a smith (a smith finds it when working). The former owner pays a visit to the finder and tells his story. The finder gives him three pastries (caskets), one filled with earth, one with bones and one with the treasure. The miser chooses the wrong one. Thereupon the new owner tries to repay the miser and gives him a cake with the money inside. The miser pays for other goods with it and finally, after other events, the money reaches the predestined owner again [N212]. Cf. Types 736, 736A, 745, 841, 947, 947A, 961, and 961B.

|750A       The Three Wishes (previously The Wishes). (The Poor and the Rich.) Christ and St. Peter (God, other supernatural being) visit the mortals [K1811]. A poor farmer who receives them hospitably is granted three  good wishes; a rich man, who refused hospitality, receives three evil wishes [D1761.0.2, Q1.1]. Cf. Types 330, 471. The generous poor person uses his three wishes wisely; the selfish rich man makes two foolish wishes [J2071, J2073] (his horse’s neck broken, his wife stuck to the saddle) and must use the third to undo them. (The same with one wish: to keep doing all day what you begin [J2072.3]; one gets good linen all day, while the other throws water on a pig [D2172.2].) Or, a husband given three wishes transfers one to his wife who wastes it on a trifle. In his anger he wishes the desired article in her body and must use the third wish to get it out [J2075].

|750E      Flight to Egypt. This miscellaneous type comprises various tales deal- ing with the journey of the Holy Family to Egypt [cf. R220ff.]. The events are usually miraculous: (1)  Helping  trees/persons:  Trees  [A2711.4]  (weeping  willow, poplar, alder, fig [A2711.7], palm), plants (fern, broom, thornbush, thistle [A2711.4.2], hazelnut [A2711.4.1], rose), fruits (date, pine cone, lupine seed), birds (quail, lark, nightingale, partridge, swal low, wag- tail, pipit, bullfinch), other animals (donkey, sheep, goats, wolves), people (smith, mason, farmer, blind man, Gypsy), and vari ous things (river, well, stream, hoofprints) help the Holy Family on their flight by sheltering them from the sun or from a storm, or by hiding them from pursuers. The helpers are blessed for their assist ance [A2711.3, A2711.4.3, A2221.5, Q46.1]. (2) In the corn-legend a farmer tricks the men (soldiers) who pursue the Holy Family by telling them that the fugitives passed by when a field of grain, which is now ripe, was sown. The pursuers give up, not knowing that the grain grew and ripened in a single day [D2157.2]. (3) Mary washes Jesus’s diapers and hangs them on a bush to dry. Their healing power causes the dried-out bush to turn green or to bloom, or imparts fragrance to its flowers. (4) Having no where else to bathe Jesus, Mary washes him in certain natural springs, which then and ever after produce warm water. (5) Jesus soothes wolves, which aid the family in their flight. (6) A spider spins its web over a cave in which the Holy Family is hiding. Thinking that no one could have entered the cave recently, the pursuers do not look inside for them [B523.1]. Cf. Type 967. (7) Animals [A2231.7.1] (beetle [A2231.7.1.1]) or plants [A2721.4] betray the Holy Family on the way to Egypt and are cursed. (8) Gypsies refuse to give the Holy Family refuge, and for this they are condemned to wander ever after [Q292.1]. Cf. Type 777. 

Remarks: The flight of the Holy Family to Egypt appears in the New Testament  
(Matthew II,13–23), which is the source for the apocryphal gospel, Pseudo-Mat- 
thew.

|751E*     Man in the Moon. This miscellaneous type includes various narra tives dealing with a man (woman, animal, object) on the moon [A751ff.]. Examples: A man (watercarriers, a woman with a butter churn, a man with a bucket of tar [A751.4]) is sent to (can be seen on) the moon for punish ment.

Remarks: Most of these tales are etiological, and explain the dark marks on the  
moon.

|751F*     The Mouse Tower of Bingen [Q415.2, Q291]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A knight who had plundered the property of St. Clement is attacked at night in his bedroom by an army of mice. Unable to ward them off, he prays to be hung in a chest from the ceiling. The mice go away. When the chest is taken down, the knight is found inside gnawed to death by other mice. Or, the Polish King Popiel flees from mice to a wooden tower on an island. Even there the mice find him and kill him. (2) A prominent cleric (Archbishop Hatto I or II) levies taxes dur- ing a famine and demands that those who do not pay (the poor) be burn ed to death. As they die, he likens their cries to the sound of squealing rats (mice). God punishes him for this cruel deed by pla- guing him with mice. In order to get rid of the mice, the bishop flees to a tower on a rock in the Rhine (near Bingen). The mice attack him even there and eat him up. 

Remarks: Tale with legendary traits. Documented in the early Middle Ages, e.g.  
in Annales Quedlinburgenses and Chronicon episcoporum Merseburgiensorum.

|751G*     Bread Turned to Stone.  (Including the previous Type 368*.) This mis cellaneous  type  comprises  various  tales  dealing  with  bread (that has not been shared during a famine [Q272]) that is turned to stone  [D471.1, D661, M411.2] (and/or gives forth blood [D474]). Ex- amples: (1) A poor woman asks her sister for bread for her children. The sister hides her bread and refuses, saying,  “If I had any bread, I would rather wish it would turn to stone”. Immediately, her bread turns into stone. (When her husband later tries to cut the bread she had hidden, blood flows from it.) (2) A lay brother (baker) hides his bread instead of giving any to the poor. It turns to stone, and is hung on the church door as a warn ing.

|753       Christ and the Smith. Christ (St. Peter, St. Eligius, saint) visits [K1811] a haughty smith [F663.0.1], takes off a horse’s foot in order to shoe it, and replaces the foot [E782.4]. He rejuvenates an old woman by putting her in the fire [D1886, E121.2]. The smith tries to do the same with his old mother-in-law but only deforms her [J2411.1]. The smith’s wife and daughter, both pregnant, are so shocked at seeing her that both give birth to a mon key. This explains the origin of monkeys [A1861.2]. In  some  variants  the  attempt  at  rejuvenation  produces  a monkey .

|754       Lucky Poverty (previously The Happy Friar). A poor man (cobbler, weaver, smith, porter, falconer) is happy despite of his meagre living conditions. A rich man, seeing this apparent contradiction, gives him money. The poor man worries about his new wealth and loses his former happiness. Finally he returns the money so as to be happy again [J1085.1]. Cf. Type 844. 

Remarks: Based on the notion of the poor but happy man (Horace, Epistolae [I,7,46– 
98]), this type has been well documented since the Middle Ages, e.g. Jacques de  
Vitry, Sermones vulgares (Jacques de Vitry/Crane, No. 66).

|755        Sin and Grace. A woman (on the advice of an old woman, devil) prevents the birth of her illegitimate children [T572.1] by using magic to procure abortions (kills the children, marries only when infertile, makes a contract with the devil). Later her husband (priest, preacher) realizes that she throws no shadow [F1038, Q552.9] and casts her out as a sinner [Q251]. She cannot be pardoned until a rose grows from a stone table [F971.2, Q431.4]. A churchman takes the woman at night into the church. The (souls of the) unborn children appear one by one, whip (rend) her, and finally forgive her. When the woman returns home a rose springs up [F971.2]. (She dies or her body is torn up by animals.) Cf. Types 756A–756C, 762, and 765.

|756A       The Self-Righteous Hermit. A hermit mistrusts divine justice, or a man who thinks he is without sin complains about God’s decision of his place after death (punishment [hell] or reward [heaven]). Cf. Types 756B, 756C. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) An angel ceases to appear to a hermit [Q553.2] because he spoke disparagingly of an evil-doer who was taken to the gallows. Thereupon the hermit has to do hard penance [L435.1] by wander-

The hermit converts a band of robbers with the story of his misfortune. The next morning the hermit is found dead, with green twigs on his small dry branch [F971.1]. (2) A discontented hermit, an evil-doer, and a naked man covered  with sand worry about their place in heaven. Angel Gabriel tells them God’s answers to their questions: the place of the hermit will be in hell because he doubts God’s justice, the evil-doer will be in heaven because of his hospitality, and even the sand will be re moved from the naked man because of his ingratitude and impa tience. (3) A criminal has to do penance after confession: every time he passes a crucifix he should say the Lord’s prayer. When doing so he is killed by the relative of one of his former victims. The hermit, his father confessor, sees that the criminal is taken into heaven by angels, and he decides to leave God’s service. When he leaves his cell, he breaks his neck and is taken by the devil. (4) A murderer overhears the confession of a dying hermit. In despair the criminal utters a fast prayer regretting not having lived a life like the pious hermit’s. The hermit hears the exclamation and as he dies, he behaves haughtily towards the criminal, whereupon his soul is taken by the devil. The criminal runs away, falls into a pit, and is taken into heaven by angels.

|756B      Robber Madej (previously The Devil’s Contract). A boy who intends to become a priest has been sold to the devil by his parents before birth [M211, S211, S222–S226, S240]. When the boy becomes aware of this contract he first asks a priest, then a bishop, and finally the pope for advice.   The boy wants to go to hell in order to dissolve the contract [F81. 2], and the pope sends him to a hermit [N843]. The hermit di rects him to his brother, a robber. The robber takes him to hell [H1235]. In hell the boy obtains his contract [H1273.1] (after many efforts to per suade the devil) and sees the fiery bed (chair) prepared for the robber [F771.1.9, J172, Q561].   In anticipating his punishments the robber decides (is told) to do penance [Q520.2] until his dry staff puts forth fresh blooms and fruit [Q521.1.1, Q521.1.2]. Assured of forgiveness, he dies happy and goes to heaven [Q172.3] (cf. Type 756C).   The hermit is astonished but reconciles himself to God’s judg- ment (blasphemes God and is damned [Q312.3]). The boy returns from hell and becomes a priest. Cf. Types 756A, 756C.

|756C        The Two Sinners (previously The Greater Sinner). A robber seeks to do penance [Q520.1] for murdering ninety-nine men or for murder- ing his parents [Q211.1] (for shooting at a consecrated wafer [C55.2, Q222.1]). After being rejected by several confessors [V29.1] he is as- signed the following penance by an old man: to “plant” a firebrand  (live coals, small twig, axe, garden) and to wait until it grows into a green tree [Q521.1.1]; to water the firebrand with water brought from a distance in his mouth [Q521.1.2]; to carry a bag of stones (one for each murder) on his back or an iron hoop on his head till it falls off [Q521.2, Q521.3]; to pasture black sheep till they be come white

Furthermore he should behave mercifully, carry a traveler over a stream, and offer free hospitality to all [Q523. 5].  For many years the robber does penance in vain until he inter- cepts a man who is about to commit a great crime. The robber kills the man and then regrets the deed. Thereupon the firebrand blooms (the stones or the hoop fall off or the sheep turn white). His confes sor tells him that all his sins have been forgiven because of the crime that was prevented by his last murder (because God is pleased with the hundredth murder) [Q545]. Cf. Types 756A, 756B.

When the pilgrims return they say that they have also seen their friend who had stayed behind at the grave (their friend’s name on the table in church). So they realize that the soul of a person who does good goes to Christ’s grave. Cf. Type 759A.

|756G*     Faith Moves Mountains [D1766.1, D2136.3.1]. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A sultan orders that all Christians in his domain be put to death unless they can, by the strength of their belief, move a certain mountain. A poor (one-eyed, blind) shoemaker accomplishes the miracle: the power of his words pushes the mountain into the sea (along with the sultan and his courtiers). Thus the Christians are freed from their imprisonment. (2) A bishop imprisoned by heathens must demonstrate the power of his belief by moving a mountain. While he hesitates, a youth in his service accomplishes the miracle by the strength of his belief. The witnesses are so impressed that they convert to Chris tianity. (3) A Catholic craftsman uses his hammer to strike a mountain, which is moved into the sea. 

Remarks: This tale has been widespread since the Middle Ages. The oldest version  
is by Michael von Tani and Severus ibn al-Muqaffa, Siyar al-bīʿa al-muqaddasaʿ  
(10th/11th century); see Matthew (XVII,20, cf. XXI,21), and Luke (XVII,6). Popular  
as a proverbial phrase.

|757       The Emperor’s Haughtiness Punished (previously The King’s Haughti- ness Punished). (Jovinian, Roderigo.) The emperor Jovinian feels like God. When he bathes, a stranger (angel) who looks like him takes away his clothes and reigns in his place [L411]. When Jovinian re- turns naked to the court nobody recognizes him and he is driven away. In his despair he starts to regret his former haughtiness. Later, when he asks again for the sovereignty, he is accepted as emperor. The stranger who had ruled in his place discloses himself as his guard ian angel and disappears. From then on the emperor lives humbly in a godfearing manner.

|758       The Various Children of Eve. After the expulsion from paradise Eve gives birth to a child every year. Her children are all different: some beautiful, some ugly. When God pays her a visit Eve bathes her beautiful children and dresses them nicely. She hides the ugly ones. (She is ashamed of the number of her children and therefore hides some.) When God arrives he blesses the beautiful children and des- tines them to become kings, earls, citizens or traders. Thereupon Eve wants her ugly children (hidden in the straw, hay, oven) to be bles sed as well. God destines those to be farmers, fishermen, smiths, tanners, shoemakers and servants. Upon Eve’s protest God explains that every class is necessary and legitimate for the functioning of society. Sometimes Eve consents to God’s will [A1650.1]. Cf. Type 1416.

|759       Angel and Hermit (previously God’s Justice Vindicated) [J225.0.1]. A saint (Moses, Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi, St. Peter, hermit) doubts God’s justice and blames him for sending suffering to virtuous people and well-being to bad ones. Or, a saint asks God for the reason for his decisions, an angel asks a saint (hermit) to accompany him to see God’s secret decisions, or, an angel and a hermit meet and decide to travel together. The angel (God’s messenger) forbids his companion to speak or to ask questions [C410, C411.1, C423.2, C491]. On their way the angel does many seemingly unjust and cruel things: he kills the child and/or the servant of a hospitable host and a man he meets in the street [J225.4, J225.5]; he repays hospitality by stealing a cup [J225.3], in hospitality by giving a cup (present); he repays an in hospitable person by constructing a house (rebuilding a fallen wall); he des troys the house (harvest) of hospitable people; he damages (sinks) a ship because of one sinner on board [J225.0.2, U21.3]; he kills the only cow of a poor woman; he offers good wishes to inhospitable people, and bad wishes to hospitable ones. Later the angel explains why each of these strange deeds was just. When the hermit sees the justification for each deed, he agrees that none of God’s acts should be blamed or doubted. God’s deeds are always justified. Cf. Types 759*, 840.

|759A      The Sinful Priest. A man refuses to receive holy communion from an unworthy priest [V31.1]. God sends him a dream of unbearable thirst. He finds a well where a leper draws water for many people to drink. When he also wants to drink from it, the leper draws back his hand and says, “Why do you want to take water from a leper’s hand but you refuse to receive the sacrament from an unworthy priest?” It is reprehensible to say that the power of the sacrament depends on the virtue of the man who gives it [J157.1, V39.3]. Cf. Type 756E*.

|759C      The Widow’s Flour. A poor woman shares her small property with beggars but loses her last flour (bread) in a storm. When some traders  arrive safely in spite of a leak (calm) she complains to the king (Solo- mon) about the injustice of the wind. In thanks for their rescue, the traders deliver a certain amount (of money) to the king to be given to the poor. At first they do not know where the leak is, but then they discover that a flour sack plugged the hole. The poor woman identifies the sack as the one she had lost, and the king gives her the money as compensation. (The god of the winds has to pay for the compensation) [J355.1].

|759D      The Punishment of the Angel. (Including the previous Type 795.) An angel (the death) is sent by God to take the soul of a widow with two children [E722.2.10]. He does not fulfill the task [A106.2, E754.2.2.1, V233.1]. Thereupon God, in order to show that he cares even for the smallest creatures, tells the angel to fetch a stone out of the sea where a small worm is hidden [D1810.0.1]. The angel is punished by becoming deaf, blind or senseless, or he is driven out of the sky. He has to do penance for his sin on earth [A106.2.1] by pretending to be human and by serving a man (abbot, hermit, custodian, farmer) [A1549.4] on earth. As a servant he works for his master [D1811.2] but he acts in a ridiculous and strange way, smiling mysteriously [N456, M304]. He mocks a man who buys shoes that will last a long time, because the man will die soon. He throws stones at a church (wedding pro- cession) because he sees the devil there. He favors a pub because the people inside pray and ask for God’s mercy. At the burial of a digni- tary he behaves disrespectfully, while at the burial of a poor man he renders his reverence [J225.8, J225.0.1.1]. He mocks holy things and scorns a crucifix (holy statue, shrine). He contradicts a judg ment, saying it is wrong. He insults a beggar for being in reality a rich

When he meets an emperor and his brother, a bishop, he smiles because he recognizes them as the two pitiful children who were the reason why he had been punished, and who had both achieved high positions. By this the angel finally learns something about divine justice.

|760       The Unquiet Grave. A man burns his three pregnant fiancées (wife, wives). After the man’s death his corpse reappears (again and again) in the church [E411.1, Q211.3]. Guests come to the parsonage to see the corpse. The clergyman’s maidservant is paid to take the dead man and return him to his grave [E411.0.2]. But the corpse holds her fast and asks her to beg his murdered fiancées’ pardon when they come to the church. They agree only after the third time, whereupon the corpse returns to the grave and finds rest. In some variants a boy who mocks the church (clergyman, Virgin Mary) is condemned and sinks to earth as a stone. Later the stone is found and carried into a room where it laughs and tells its story. A special word cancels the curse and the corpse in the form of the stone changes to dust.

The dead man’s body (skeleton, skull, bone, hand, etc.) is re moved (because of a wager) from the cemetery. The dead man is willing to be taken back to his grave only by the person (brave girl) who had taken him out of it. (The skeleton clings to the girl until they reach home, where it explains that it could not find peace be cause in its lifetime it had slandered an illegitimate child. It asks the girl to beg the mother’s pardon.) Once it has been forgiven the skeleton disintegrates to ashes and finds peace (deliverance).

The first child who lies in a cradle (coffin) made from the wood of this tree will be the one who lays the soul to rest [D791. 1.3]. In some variants, the child must become a priest. When he serves his first mass, the restless soul will be able to rest.

|762        Woman with Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Children. A childless noblewoman accuses a poor mother of twins (triplets) of adultery [T587.1], whereupon the woman curses her to bear as many children as there are days (months) in a year [T586.1]. In the absence of her husband she gives birth to seven (nine, twelve, thirteen, or more) children (sons) [T586.1]. Being ashamed she orders her servant to drown all except one. The servant meets the father on his return and pretends to be carrying puppies in the basket. The father secretly educates the children and finally presents them to his wife and some guests. Guests and sons pray for mercy for the mother. From this time children of multiple birth have been called Guelfs (Dogs, Trazegnies, Porcelets, etc.) [L435.2.1]. Cf. Types 755, 765.

|763        The Treasure Finders Who Murder One Another. Three (two, more) men (hunters, friends, brothers) find (rob) a treasure. When one of them goes to town to fetch some food, the others plan to murder one another in order not to share the treasure. Those who stayed kill (stab to death, drown) the one who left when he returns, but they die later from eating bread (wine) which he had poisoned [K1685]. In some variants Christ travels with some of his followers. When they find a treasure he tells them not to touch it but to continue their way. Later two of them return secretly to take the treasure and they murder one another.

FFC 284                            Religious Tales                               425 king, but leaves because the king fears the devil. The giant serves the devil, but he leaves him when he refuses to pass a crossroads. A hermit (ferryman) tells the giant to carry a child across the river. The child becomes heavier with each step and finally explains the reason: that he is Christ who carries the sins of the world. The giant is doubtful, but then his staff changes into a blossoming plum (fig) tree. Thus he is convinced and from then on he bears the name Christophorus – the man who carried Christ [Q25]. 

Remarks: Early version documented in the Middle Ages, e.g. Legenda aurea (Chris- 
tophorus). The beginning of the legend is found only in early variants, and most  
variants start with Christophorus carrying the child across the river.

|769       The Child’s Grave (previously Dead Child’s Friendly Return to Par- ents) [E324, E361]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A mother discovers her dead child in a procession of dead children. It is forced to carry a heavy jug and tells its mother to stop weeping because it has to collect all her tears in the jug. From then on the mother stops weeping. (2) A dead child returns to tell its mother to stop weeping. Its shroud is so wet from her tears that the child cannot find rest in the grave. From then on the mother bears her pain without weeping and her child stays quiet in the grave.

|770A*     Guardian Angel. This miscellaneous type includes different tales dealing with people who are protected by an invisible being (angel) from danger, injury, or acting badly [V238]. Examples: (1) A priest offends the new (second) wife of a prince. The prince wants to take revenge. He summons the priest, intending to shoot him. When the priest arrives, the prince instead invites him to dinner. The courtiers ask the prince why he suddenly changed his mind. He says that someone standing next to him told him what to do. No one else saw such a person, so the prince thinks it must have been an angel. (2) A girl going through a forest is followed by a man who tries to rape her. She falls to her knees and prays to God, and the man lets her go. A few days later he attacks another girl and is arrested. He is asked why he let the first girl go, and replies that someone was with her. (3) A clergyman who is disliked by his congregation is called to go to the house of someone who is dying. When he arrives he finds no one there. He thinks he was the victim of a prank and goes home. Years later when he goes again to a deathbed, he learns that the false summons had been made by someone who intended to kill him. But the villain saw that the clergyman was accompanied by someone else (angel, man dressed in white) and gave up his plan.

|772       Wood for the Holy Cross. This miscellaneous type comprises vari- ous legends dealing with the wood used for the Holy Cross (wood from a tree in Paradise used for Jesus’s Crucifixion; the Holy Cross rediscovered by St. Helena and recovered by the Emperor Heraclius) [A2221.2.2, A2721.2.1, Z352]. Examples: Adam’s son Seth wants to bring oil from the tree of mercy to his dying father. An angel gives him instead a branch (seed) from the Tree of Life (Tree of Knowledge), which Seth plants on Adam’s grave. Later, Solomon has this tree cut down to use in his temple. The beam does not fit so it is used as a bridge and subsequently buri ed. It is discovered just in time to be used to make the cross for the Crucifixion. Cf. Type 772*. 

Remarks: Legends about the wood of the Holy Cross begin with a few apoc ryphal  
motifs in the 11th and 12th centuries.

|773        Contest of Creation between God and the Devil. This miscellaneous type comprises different tales dealing with the theme, “God and the devil as creators”. [A1750ff., A2286.2ff.]. They have a strong dualistic tendency. Examples: (1) The creation of contrasting animals. The devil makes crea- tures in competition with God (often copies the creatures God made) [A1751]. (2) The devil tries to create humans but fails, and instead he creates certain animals [A1755, A1811, A1833.1, A1862, A1893]. For example, God makes Adam out of clay and the devil tries to copy him. He shapes the clay and blows life into it, but it turns into a mon- key. In other variants, the devil makes inferior races of humans. (3) The good principle competes with the bad one, as God and the devil create various animals. God creates a wolf which is called “God’s dog”, and the destructive devil deliberately creates goats [A63.4]. The devil’s animals devour God’s animals [A2286.2.1]. (4) The devil’s animals are brought to life by God [A1217]. The devil shapes some animals but only God (the name of God) can bring them to life. When the devil refuses to utter God’s name, the animals remain lifeless [A1756]. (5) God takes the devil’s animals. The devil creates (owns) ani mals that God wants for himself. God alters the appearance (colors) of the devil’s animals so that he cannot recognize them [A1750ff., K483].

|774A       St. Peter Wants to Create a Man (replaces the head of an innocent, beheaded person). He puts the head on backwards [E34, E783.1]. St. Peter consoles himself with the idea that the resuscitated person could become a rope-maker who has to walk backwards while work - ing. In some variants Christ asks St. Peter to settle a dispute between a woman and the devil. Thoughtlessly he cuts off the heads of both. When he puts the heads back, he exchanges them. Since that time it is said that women have had the devil inside their bodies. Cf. Type 1169.

Or, St. Peter protests when a ship is sunk by Christ because one sinner is aboard. Christ sends him to fetch honey from a hive. St. Peter crushes all the bees when one stings him.

|775       Midas’ Short-sighted Wish. Phrygian farmers take an old man (Si- len) to Midas (to a nameless poor man), who recognizes him as the educator of Dionysos. Midas organizes a feast for the old man and then hands him over to Dionysos. The grateful Dionysos gives Midas a wish. He wishes that everything he touches will turn to gold [J2072.1]. Even his food and drink turn to gold so that he cannot eat. He asks Dionysos to take back the gift. Dionysos agrees and Midas has to bathe in the river Paktolos. From that time on the river contains gold. In some variants Midas dies from hunger and thirst. Cf. Type 782. 

Remarks: For the story of Midas, see Ovid, Metamorphoses (XI,85–173).

|777*         The Flying Dutchman. A captain (Dutchman) is unable to sail around a cape (reach a harbor) because of a strong wind. He swears that he will reach his goal, even if it takes forever. (He is condemned to sail forever because of his sins.)    Ordinary sailors who encounter this ship believe it to be a ghost ship (they see it in different forms). Often its crew give them letters addressed to people who died long ago.    Meeting the Flying Dutchman portends storm, shipwreck, or death [E511–E512].

|778       To Sacrifice a Giant Candle. (Including the previous Type 1553A*.) A sailor (farmer, Gypsy) in distress at sea (in a difficult situation) promises to sacrifice a giant candle (as high as a mast, as long as a pole) more expensive than he can afford. When he is asked to pro- duce it, he replies that the candle would become smaller by itself, or he discharges his promise by offering a small light, or does not fulfill the promise at all [K231.3, K231.3.1]. Cf. Type 1718*. Version from the Middle Ages: A farmer leading a cow and a calf to St. Michael fears the sea and calls on the saint for help, promising to sacrifice the calf. When free from danger, he says that St. Michael was foolish to expect him to give the calf. Again the sea rises, again the farmer calls for help, and St. Michael appears. Now the farmer promises to sacrifice both the cow and the calf, but again he does not discharge his promise. The third time the sea swallows him up together with the animals.

When a priest (sexton) asks him why he does this, he explains that one never knows where one will end up. So it is wise to be on good terms with both.

On  Christmas  Eve,  outside  a church, a farmer of (the fictitious town) Kolbeck holds a dance with fifteen other farmers and three women, while a mass is said. When the priest comes out of the church, he curses all the dancers in God’s name. From then on they have to dance ceaselessly [Q386]. They dance themselves into the earth, hollowing out a hole, and finally die. After their death, as many stones as there were dancers were set up as a memorial.

|779F*     Mass of the Dead. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A woman (man) who thinks she has overslept for an early church service (during Advent, on Christmas or New Year’s) hurries to church. She finds it brightly lit and filled with unfamiliar wor- shipers – it is the Mass of the Dead. A dead acquaintance (neigh- bor) tells her to leave. Terrified, she runs away, but leaves a piece of clothing behind. She goes back but cannot retrieve it because the church door will not open. The next morning, the clothing is found, ripped to shreds, in the graveyard [E492, E242]. In some variants, the witness becomes ill and dies shortly after. (2) A person accidentally witnesses a Mass of the Dead (during Advent, on Christmas or New Year’s, on All Saint’s Day, All Souls Day, or the day of a particular saint). A priest asks him if he will re ceive (serve) Holy Communion. The man agrees and is blessed. The priest tells him that he had been unable to rest in peace until he could administer this sacrament to a living person. The visitor dies shortly after [E492, E242].

|779J*     Breaking the Sabbath.  (Including the previous Types 368B* and 1705B*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various religious leg ends dealing with offences against the commandment to rest on Sunday (another holy day) by people who work in the house or fields, go hunting, or participate in forbidden amusements [C631]. Punish- ments for these offences are various (cf. Type 751E*). Exam ples: Hay harvested on Sunday turns to stone. Someone who goes picking berries instead of going to church becomes ill (dies, is lost). Someone who goes hunting instead of to church suffers an acci- dent (dies). Someone who plays bowls on Sunday is killed by a ball. A choirboy who plays cards behind the organ is caught by the devil.

Remarks: The biblical narrative (and other sources) creates an etiological tale for  
the Sabbath already in Genesis, emulating God’s rest after the six days of creation  
(Gen. 2,1–3). The day of rest includes all, free men and women as well as slaves  
and working animals (Ex. 20,8–11; Dtn. 5,12–15).

|782       Midas and the Donkey’s Ears. Midas (a nameless emperor), dis gusted with his riches, has retired to the forest. Without being asked he intervenes in the judgment of a musical challenge between Pan and Apollo in favor of Pan. As punishment Apollo gives him donkey’s ears [F511.2.2] (horse’s, sheep’s or goat’s ears). Midas hides them under a crown. His barber (cossack, his foster-brother) cannot keep the secret [N465], so he digs a hole, whispers the secret into it, and covers the hole up again. But a reed growing there (a musical instrument made from the reed) gives the secret away [D1316.5, D1610.34]. Cf. Type 775.

|785       Lamb’s Heart (previously Who Ate the Lamb’s Heart?). While travel - ing on earth [K1811] God (Christ, St. Peter, Nicholas) asks his com- panion (soldier, beggar, craftsman, clergyman, St. Peter) to prepare a lamb (goat, cow, chicken). The companion secretly eats the lamb’s heart (liver, kidney, brain, tongue) and denies having done so. He explains that this sort of animal had no heart [K402]. When God shows his might by various miracles (resuscitation, healing), the man still does not tell him the truth, but instead tries to imitate God. He fails and is condemned to death. God offers his help, but the deceiver prefers to die rather than to yield. Never the less God rescues him. Later God divides a treasure into three parts. The third part is to go to the one who ate the heart, whereupon the companion con fesses that it was he who ate it [J1141.1.1]. Cf. Types 52, 753, and 753A.

He enforces his point by showing geese who stand on one leg.     The master refutes his servant’s assertion by shooting away the geese so that they use both legs [K402.1]. The servant replies that if he had frightened the roasted goose in the same way, it would have showed its second leg as well.

|788          The Man Who Was Burned Up and Lived Again. (Including the pre- vious Type 791*.) A man (hermit, saint, angel) has committed a sin and is burned (is told by an angel to burn himself). A part of his body (heart) is carried away by Christ (God, twelve apostles, St. Peter, beggar, monk, girl, mother of the dead man), and from contact with it a woman conceives and bears a child.     Or, a hunter finds the hermit’s heart in the ashes and takes it home, telling his daughter to prepare it for him. The daughter (his sister, girl) instead eats it herself and becomes pregnant from it. The newborn child can walk, talk, prophesy, can do magic things and has supernatural powers. It is the reborn hero (hermit).

|801       Master Pfriem. A self-righteous shoemaker (driver, rich man) who is never satisfied, criticizes his journeymen, his servants, and his wife. He dreams he is dead. Before he is admitted to heaven, St. Peter warns him [A661.0.1.2] against fault-finding [F13]. Despite his good intentions he continues to complain. He criti cizes angels who carry a beam crosswise [F171.6.3], and other angels who carry water in a sieve [H1023.2] (cf. Typ 1180) or pull a wagon with two horses harnessed in front and behind [F171.6.4]. Finally the faultfinder is expelled from heaven [Q312.1]. When he awakes from his dream, he continues to criticize the things he had seen there, showing that his character did not change. Cf. Types 800, 805, 1180, 1248, and 1656.

|802       The Farmer in Heaven. A poor farmer (beggar, old woman, poor girl, preacher) arrives in heaven at the same time as a rich man (priest, lawyer, townsman, nun, hermit, saint, old couple). The rich man en- ters first and the poor man outside overhears that he is received with rejoicing. When the farmer enters nothing similar happens. When the farmer complains that things in heaven are handled as partially as on earth, St. Peter explains that poor people come to heaven every day, but a rich man comes only once in a hundred years [E758, W245]. 

Remarks: This tale is based in the religious principle expressed in Matthew XIX,  
23–24, “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich  
man to enter into the kingdom of God”.

St. Peter (other saint) in heaven [A661.0.1.2] is allowed to free his mother (sinner, witch, his father, woodcutter; clergyman, thief) from hell (purgatory). When she is pulled to heaven on a rope (stalk) [F51.1.3] the other inhabi tants of the hell (the dead) catch her feet in order to be freed as well. She does not want them to come up and kicks them away. The rope tears and she falls back into hell (St. Peter acknowledges her bad character and casts her out) [Q291.1].

|804A      The Beanstalk to Heaven. An old couple climb up a beanstalk (which grows through the roof of their house) to heaven. The old man climbs carrying his wife in a sack which he holds with his teeth. The old woman keeps asking him, “Is heaven still far away?” When he an- swers, she falls to earth (her husband reaches heaven). In another variant an old couple who climbed to heaven on a bean stalk promise not to eat bread dough (pie, apples) and not to sit in God’s little carriage. They break their promise (the woman sits in the little carriage, which promptly drives off with her) and they are cast out of heaven.

But he payed the devil by taking a beating instead of his soul, so he is not allowed to enter either hell nor heaven. Thereupon he starts to run a tavern (named “Nobiskrug”) between heaven and hell (outside heaven’s gate, out- side hell’s gate). In some variants so many people remain at the tavern in front of the entrance to heaven that finally the host is allowed to enter heaven as a preventive measure. Or, many candidates for heaven bring their own drinks from earth (they are already drunk), so that the host has to close his business.

|808A      The Death of the Good and of the Bad Man. When a good man dies, a bee (his soul) flies out of his mouth. A white and black bird fight over it and the white bird catches it. When a bad man dies, the black bird catches the bee [E721, E734. 2, E751.1, E756.1]. Cf. Types 756B, 808. In an Estonian variant an angel shows a rich man how a good man dies by taking him to a deathbed. Two white doves sit at the head of the bed and two black ravens at the foot. When the man dies the doves fly up and take his soul away. At the deathbed of a bad man, the two ravens sit at the head and the doves are at the foot. When the man dies the ravens take his soul away and the doves cry. 

Remarks: Animals (serpent, mouse, ant, etc.) that come out of the mouths of  
sleep ing persons or out of their body as a soul-animal [E721, E730] are also found  
in other  tales (e.g. Types 840, 1645A), but there the animals have a different func- 
tion.

|812       The Devil’s Riddle. (Including the previous Type 812*.) A man (three starving soldiers) promises himself to the devil (in the shape of a dragon) for money (food) [M211]. If, at the end of a certain time (seven years), he can solve three (seven) riddles which the devil pro- pounds, he will be released from the contract. The devil has objects  which appear different from what they really are [H523], and the man must guess their real nature: he-goat – horse, cloth – goat-skin, gold cup – cup of pitch, roasted meat – dead dog, spoon – whale-rib, wineglass – horse’s hoof. Or the devil asks seemingly impossible questions: what is sweet- er than honey [H671], softer than swan’s-down [H672], harder than stone [H673]? Or he asks for the symbolic meaning of the numbers  one to seven (ten, twelve) [H602.1.1, Z22] (cf. Type 2010]). Or he sets impossible tasks [H1010]. An old woman (devil’s grandmother) helps the man to solve the riddles. Or he finds the solutions by hiding in a tree and overhearing the devil’s conversation with a companion [N451.1, G661.1, G661.2]. Or he is hidden by the devil’s grandmother, who gets the secrets from the devil [G530.4], or is helped by another being (angel, St. Andrew, Gypsy) [N810]. Finally the man saves his soul and escapes from the devil [H543].

While the devil veri fies the things the man is thinking about, three nights pass and afterwards the man receives the money from the devil.

|819*      The Devil’s Portrait. A painter is ordered by his master (the king) to paint a portrait of the devil. As he has never seen the devil, he does not know how to paint him. Then the devil appears and assists by showing himself (the painter paints the picture in the steam-bath, he paints only single parts, the devil presents himself only one part at a time). The painter does not look at the finished portrait (may not look at it). When his master looks at it, he dies (all those in the palace who look at it are frightened and flee or die, the king does not die). In a German variant a rich farmer orders a poor painter to paint the devil and offers him his farm as payment. The painter is worried because he does not know what the devil looks like. On the third night his guardian angel appears and tells him he should close his eyes and paint single parts on a paper roll. Every section should be rolled up immediately. He should never look at it and should burn it after the farmer sees it. When the farmer looks at the painting, he dies, and the painter becomes the owner of the farm.

He does a wonderful job: he mows and threshes as never before and carries the whole harvest plus a bull on his back. When the noble man realizes that the workman must be the devil, the devil takes him to hell, and the day laborer becomes the owner of the whole harvest and the bull.

|820A      The Devil Mows with a Magic Sickle. A poor old innkeeper works as a farmhand for a rich landlord. The malicious foreman abuses the workmen but especially the innkeeper who cannot mow as fast as the others. The devil comes to the innkeeper and offers to mow for him in his shape at the landlord’s farm. He would bring his own sickle. As the devil mows with his sickle, he follows the foreman. He mows faster than all other workmen and the foreman tries desperately to keep up with him. He exhausts himself and dies of overexertion (the devil takes his soul, wrings his neck). The devil gives his sickle to the old innkeeper, who becomes the best mower from then on [M213].

|821B      Chickens from Boiled Eggs. A traveler (soldier, sailor, merchant, stu- dent) eats a meal of eggs in an inn and leaves without paying. Some years later when he returns to pay his debt, the innkeeper claims the value of all chickens that would have hatched from the eggs in the meantime. The traveler cannot (is not willing to) pay such an enormous sum, so the innkeeper brings the case to trial. The traveler meets a man (devil, farmer, shepherd, servant, wise man, lawyer, Gypsy, child) who offers to act for him as his lawyer. On the day of the trial the lawyer comes late and excuses himself by explaining that he was cooking beans (other seed) for planting [J1191.2]. The judge states that cooked beans could not germinate, and the lawyer answers that chickens could not be hatched from boiled eggs. The case is rejected (the devil carries off the judge). Cf. Types 875, 875E, and 920A.

|822*      The Mythical Creditor (previously The Devil Lends Money to the Man). A supernatural being (devil) lends money to a poor man on the condition that he will claim the man’s soul if the man does not repay the debt within one year. When the poor man comes to pay his debt, the supernatural being is no longer there (is dead, is killed by lightning or has been disappeared secretly) [K231.4]. In some variants the farmer avoids having to repay his debt to the devil by giving excuses, or he exempts himself from the obli gation to pay by solving the devil’s riddles (cf. Type 812), by des troy ing the written agreement, or by giving the devil a brooding hen instead of his mother or his “pungent smell” instead of his soul.

|825       The Devil in Noah’s Ark [K485]. This miscellaneous type comprises various anecdotes dealing with the devil in Noah’s ark. The motifs mentioned do not all occur in any single variant. God commands Noah to build the ark in secret to escape the deluge [A1015, A1021]. In order to keep the work secret, the ham- mer is silent or the axe never gets dull on the stone chopping block [H1199.13, cf. H1116.1, F837]. The devil finds out the secret of the construction of the ark from Noah’s wife. He persuades her to give Noah an intoxicating drink [K2213.4.2], so Noah tells his secret and the devil destroys the ark [cf. G303.14.1.1, K2213.4]. Noah weeps and an angel instructs him how to rebuild it. By performing a washing ritual (water circle) Noah is able to keep the devil away from the ark. A gong calls the animals to board the ark. Some creatures are barred but finally they all enter: the serpent [A2145.2], the insects, the fly [A2031.2], fabulous creatures like the unicorn [A2214.3], the phoenix [A2232.4] and the giant [F531.5.9]. By a ruse the devil manages to enter the ark: he hides near Noah’s wife (at her breast, in her work-basket, in her shadow). She does not enter the ark until Noah calls her with a curse addressed to the devil [C12.5.1, K485]. On board, the devil, in the form of a mouse, gnaws a hole in the ark and tries to sink it [A1853.1], but a cat swallows the mouse. Helpful animals (serpent, hare, fish, dog) offer to close the hole with part of their body (tail, nose); smaller animals (tortoise, salamander, rabbit) are used as a plug. The serpent demands fresh (human) blood every day for its help. After the del uge, Noah throws the serpent into a holy fire. Its ashes spread with the wind and turn into bloodsucking fleas (lice, mosquitos) [A2001].

A pious clergyman has a vision in church: he sees the devil at the altar writing down all the sins of the participants of the mass. In the name of God he takes the list, reads it to the community, and everyone repents. The devil leaves the church.

|827       A Pious Innocent Man Knows Nothing of God (previously A Shep herd Knows Nothing of God). A pious man (farmer) worships God in his own way and never goes to church. A traveling preacher teaches him how to pray properly and continues on his way. When the pious man forgets the prayer he follows the preacher’s ship by walking on the water [D2125.1, V51.1]. By this miracle the preacher recognizes the man’s holiness and understands that pious innocence is pleasing to God.

|830A      The Boastful Deerslayer. A lazy man grumbles against God because he feels neglected. An old man advises him to set a trap, and God will certainly help him. The lazy man follows his advice and catches a deer. While he is skinning the animal the old man reappears and points out that God had helped him. But the lazy man emphasizes his own ability. The old man revives the deer and it runs away [Q221.6, Q223.2, E161]. The lazy man understands too late that God helped him to catch the deer. In some variants the white spots on the deer’s belly [A2412.1.1] (the bones on the leg resembling a knife, the grey hair on the leg) are explained as a result of the skinning process.

|830B      “My Crops Will Thrive Here without God’s Blessing.” (Including the previous Types 752C* and 830C*.) Cf. Type 836. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A farmer sows crops. Unrecognized saints (God) wish him God’s blessing and a good harvest, but the farmer replies his crops will thrive without God’s blessing [C454]. When weeds grow in his field, the farmer is converted. (2) A poor and a rich man (farmer, sower, two brothers) sow crops. Saints (passers-by) greet the poor farmer, “May God help you!” The farmer thanks them for the greetings and is rewarded with a good harvest. The saints greet the rich in the same way, but he rejects their greetings by saying that his crops will also grow with out God’s blessing [C454]. His harvest is very poor and he repents his behavior too late. (3) The discourteous sower. A passer-by (God) asks a farmer what he is sowing. Rudely he answers that he is sowing stones. The passer-by wishes him a good harvest, which turns out to be stone plants. (A farmer tells Christ that he is sowing pumpkins [turnips], though his seed is maize. Thereupon he harvests only pumpkins.) [Cf. A2231.1]. (4) Weather forecast. Christ asks farmers if there will be rain. Two answer that frogs (foxes, other animals) predict rain. The third farm er says that he prays to God for rain. Only the last is blessed with rain. (Cf. Type 921B*.)

This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A poor, miserable man finds (advised in a dream, through an angel) a treasure (receives money from God), and tells a clergyman (priest, landlord, rich neighbor) about it. The clergyman disguises himself in an animal skin and pretends to be the devil. He frightens the poor man and takes the treasure. But at home he cannot take the skin off [Q551.2] (until the stolen treasure has been returned). (2) The rich man (miller, butcher, baker) fails to take the treasure because the devil himself in disguise as a traveler (black horseman, soldier, hunter) stays at the poor man’s house as an overnight guest (meets him on his way) and kills (abducts) the rich man. (Previously Type 750G*.)

|832       The Disappointed Fisherman. A fisherman always catches three fishes (bread) for himself (his wife, and his child [children]). The greedy parents kill the child (expose the children) in order to have more fish (bread) for themselves. But from then on the man catches only two fish (the fish disappear completely, they do not have any more bread) [Q553.5, cf. Q211.4]. Cf. Type 781.

|834       The Poor Brother’s Treasure. (Including the previous Types 834A and 1645B*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales all featuring the phrase “God determines” or “God will care for all” (cf. Psalm 127,2). A person (spouse, brother, sister, girl, man, relative, a rich, a lazy man, neighbor, friend, servant) tells his dream to another person (spouse, brother, sister, relative, a poor, neighbor, friend, servant) saying that in a certain place a treasure is buried (finds a treasure) [N531]. The second person tries to dig up the treasure at the indicated spot (tries to dig up a treasure at the same spot), or a third person (thieves, neighbor) overhears the conversation and digs there. But instead of the treasure the person unearths only a dead dog (dead cat, some toads, beetles, pot of ants, pot of serpents [N182], pot of glowing embers, pot of dung, skeleton). Angered by this deception he/she throws the animal (pot) into the house (bed, through the window, through the roof) of the dreamer, and everything is trans formed into gold (silver, money) [D1454]. Cf. Types 947A, 1645.

|836F*      The Miser and the Eye Ointment. A man rubs ointment on his left eye and tells a miser that he can see the treasures of the world. The miser copies him and sees mountains of gold. When he wants to rub oint ment on the right eye as well the man advises him not to do so for he will become blind. The miser does not listen and rubs it on his right eye. He is immediately blinded and becomes a beggar [D1323. 5, D1331.3.1, D1331.3.2, J514.3]. (Previously Type 726**.) Cf. Type 736.

|837       The Beggar’s Bread (previously How the Wicked Lord was Punish ed). A beggar (female beggar) periodically receives a loaf from a rich man (his wife). (A rich miser refuses to give food to a beggar.) When ever the beggar receives the bread he states, “Everything you do, you do it to yourself!” The rich man becomes tired of this (angry about the beggar’s words, wants to get rid of the beggar) so he (and his wife) puts poison into the beggar’s bread. Further on his way the beggar meets a hungry young man (trav- el er) to whom he gives his bread. The young man dies and it turns out that he is the son of the rich man. So the beggar’s state ment was true [N332.1].

|839A*     The  Hermit  and  the  Devils.  In  order  to  tempt  a  hermit  (bishop, monks), the devil (devils) disguised as a clergyman tries to rejuven- ate him or to get him married. Or, a man (pupil of the bishop) is suspected of being a devil be- cause he does not cross himself and leaves the church when in cense is burned and benedictions are said. The brother of the hermit (old man, poor man, monks) overhears the devils discuss their plan sitting under a tree (near a well, at a rock), and warns the hermit. The hermit orders all doors, windows, holes, etc. of the church to be closed. When he burns incense and asks for heaven’s blessings, the devil bursts and mice (spiders) jump out of his mouth. The bishop throws his gloves, which turn into cats and catch the mice. Or the hermit crosses himself and in place of the church (forge), only a stake remains.

|840       The Punishments of Men. When a father and his son (travelers) pass the night in a certain house, the son is unable to sleep. He sees wonder ful things happening: a snake creeps from a sleeping man’s mouth [E733.1] into his wife’s mouth; a man’s head is split by an axe, etc. In the morning the master of the house explains that these are punishments of mankind [F171.6] (he explains that the visions were caused by family disharmony and quarrels). Cf. Type 759.

sleep ing person or out of their body as a soul-animal [E721, E730] is also found

|840B*      The Judgments in This World. A virtuous man, a robber, and a thief (clergyman, farmer and host [teacher]) ask a hermit (old man, God) about their fate (which of them is most certain to go to heaven). He tells them to take three different roads, where they spend the night in various situations. When they come back and tell about their experiences (the first sleeps in a fine house, the second in a forest during a storm and the third in water), the hermit explains that the experiences they had foretell their conditions of life in future.

|841        One Beggar Trusts in God, the Other the King. Two beggars (blind men, shoemakers, craftsmen), one of whom asks God for help (cf. Type 923B), the other of whom asks the king (emperor, sultan, mas- ter), receive two loaves (flat cake, cakes, roasted chicken) from the king. In one of the loaves nothing (bones) is hidden, the other one is filled with (pieces of) gold. By this gift the king intended to reward the beggar who had asked for his help, and to demonstrate his se- cular power. But the beggars exchange their loaves, because the one who trusted  in secular power thought that his loaf was not well baked because it was so heavy. When the king learns about the exchange he agrees that God’s power is stronger than his own [N351]. Cf. Types 745A, 842, and 947.

|842A*     The Beggar Dies in Night Lodgings. A large sum of money is found in a dead beggar’s clothes (sewn up in his coat) [N524.1]. On a clergy- man’s advice, the money is used to buy pigs and fatten them. All the pigs are slaughtered except one, which leads the clergyman to the graveyard, where it sinks into the dead beggar’s grave (the beggar is seen riding in flames on one of the pigs to hell). It shows that the money was acquired in a dishonest way.

|844       The Luck-Bringing Shirt. A ruler (king, mayor, sovereign couple) is sick (unhappy). A doctor (wise man, hermit) advises him to wear (to look for) the shirt of a lucky man. Servants are sent out to look (the ruler himself looks) for such a man, but a lucky man cannot be found. Finally they meet a poor man (shepherd, boy) who seems to fit the requirement. But it turns out that the man has no shirt [N135.3]. The king dies (realizes that luck cannot be bought).

|846       Devil Always Blamed. God and the devil go for a walk on earth [K1811]. The devil complains about men’s injustice (after being criti- cized by God for his impoliteness: he did not answer the people’s greetings and showed them his tongue). He is always blamed for God’s mistakes, but whenever he does something well, God receives the thanks. The devil proves it by pushing a cow (horse, ox) into a ditch. The farmer blames him by asking which damned devil had done that. While the farmer fetches help in the village the devil pulls the ani mal out of the ditch. When the farmer comes back and sees that his cow has been saved, he exclaims, “Thank God!” [N111.4.1].

|849*       The Cross as Security. A merchant borrows money, leaving a cross (icon) as security. During a storm, fearing a shipwreck, he throws a barrel with the money into the water. The barrel floats back to the creditor. In another version a poor man borrows flour from a rich man, leaving an icon of St. Nicholas as security. The rich man threatens to destroy the icon if it is not redeemed in time. A young man over- hears the deal, procures money, redeems the icon, and places it in his mother’s house. In order to earn money he decides to sell goods at a fair. On his way he gives a lift to an old man who later helps him to endure dangers during a wake. Finally the old man revives the dead daughter of the czar and the young man marries her. The old man makes the young wife into a happy, healthy person before he leaves. The young couple returns to the boy’s mother where they learn that the icon is back in its usual place, but that it had disappeared for a while.

|850       The Birthmarks of the Princess. A princess is promised in mar riage to whoever is able to describe her birthmarks [H51.1, H525]. A young swineherd (shepherd, tailor) has hogs (geese) that dance to his magic flute. In return for his dancing hogs the princess lets the shepherd boy see her naked and thus he comes to know her secret birthmarks [K1358, K443.6]. Or a fisherman offers the princess colorful fishes. In return she undresses herself three times, so that finally he knows the answer. Another suitor (rich man) guesses the answer. As both rivals have solved the riddle, the king then gives a further  test: the princess is to marry the suitor to whom she turns in the night [H315]. The rivals sleep with her and she turns to the shepherd (because his rival has eaten bad-smelling food or has soiled the bed). Cf. Types 851, 852, and 857.

|851       The Princess Who Cannot Solve the Riddle. (Including the previous Types 851A and 876.) A princess is offered in marriage to whoever can pose a riddle that she cannot solve [H342, H551]. A man (prince,

(She marries him at this point and the tale ends here.) She sends her maidservants and then goes herself to him at night to learn the answer. He keeps her nightdress (braid) as proof [H81.2, H117]. In court, she answers his riddle but permits him to ask an- other. It refers to her night visit, and rather than answer it, she agrees to marry him. Different riddles are used, for example: (1) I ride on my father and wear (carry) my mother – he has sold his parents and bought a horse and clothes (gun). (2) I ate (am) the unborn [H792] (cf. Type 927) – a fetal animal (he was cut from his mother’s womb). (3) I drank water from neither heaven nor earth – horse’s sweat (conden sation from a lamp). (4) One killed three and three killed twelve [H802] – his horse was poisoned, birds ate it, thieves ate the birds, and all died. In Turandot the princess herself is the one to set riddles for her suitors to answer [H540.2]: riddle of the sun [H762], of the ocean [H734] of the year [H721.1]. If they are not able to find the solution they will be punished by death. (Previously Type 851A, an Oriental literary tale.)

|852       Lying Contest (previously The Hero Forces the Princess to Say, “That is a Lie”). A princess is offered in marriage to the man who can tell so big a lie that she (her father) will exclaim, “That is a lie” [H342.1]. A suitor tells impossible tales of his extraordinary great ox [X1237], of a tree that grows to the sky overnight [F54.2], of a river of honey [X1547.2], of his ascent and descent on a rope of chaff from the sky [X1757], of a great cabbage [X1423.1], stable [X1547.2, X1036.1], ani- mals [X1201], mushroom [X1424], large man [X920], a man who cuts off his head and replaces it [X1726.2], a man who cuts ice with his own hands [X1858] or of a man who drinks water from his skull [X1739.2]. When finally the suitor states that her father served his father as swineherd (when he threatens to report [falsely] her amorous con- duct [K1271.1.]), the princess (king) is brought to say the required words and she has to marry the suitor.

|853       The Hero Catches the Princess with Her Own Words. (Including the previous Type 860A*.) A princess is offered in marriage to any man who outwits her in repartee [H507.1]. On the way to the contest the young est of three brothers (stupid boy, suitor) picks up rubbish: a dead crow, an egg, and other objects. The (two) elder brothers fail in talking to the princess. The youngest brother, by producing these objects at the proper time, is able to give an eloquent (often obscene) answer to each of the princess’ questions [H507.1.0.1]. He wins her as his bride. In some variants he is imprisoned and escapes by means of his magic tablecloth [D1395.2], magic purse [D1395.3] and magic fiddle [D1415.2.5]. He uses his magic fiddle to capture the princess and will release her only if she says, “No” to all his questions [K1331, Type 853A]. By this means he wins her to his desires and marries her [L161].

|853A      “No.” A king with a daughter of a marriageable age is told about the conversation of three of his officers (suitors, young men, soldiers). One says that he intends to love the queen, another wants to sleep with the princess, the third wants gold. The first gets nothing, the third receives the gold. Then the king advises his daughter that she must answer all the questions of the second suitor (suitors who wanted to sleep with the princess) with “No”. By a clever framing of his questions the suitor overcomes her resistance and marries her (the princess agrees to the suitor’s ques- tion by saying “No”) [K1331]. Cf. Types 851, 853.

|854       The Golden Ram. A young man (soldier) writes on a wall (states), “Money is all powerful” (“With money one can even win the prin- cess”). The king is provoked and sets what he believes to be an im- pos sible task. The young man receives as much money as he wants, but within a certain time he has to seduce (find) the princess [H322]. If he fails he will be condemned to death. The princess is hidden in a secret place (tower, room under earth, island, secret room, iron palace at the bottom of the sea) and guard- ed. The young man demands a hollow golden (silver, copper) ani- mal statue (ram, goat, lion, deer, elephant, ox, horse, dancing bear, bird, eagle) and hides inside it [K1341.1]. The king buys the statue (which can play music) and installs it in his daughter’s room as en- ter tainment.

When the statue is damaged it has to be sent for repair, and the youth comes out. Having won the contest the youth may now marry the princess (after she has become pregnant or has given birth to his child). In some variants a king offers his daughter to whoever is able to find her. Three sons of a merchant travel and reach the town where the contest is held. Two of them fail to find the princess and are kill ed. The third, on the advice of an old woman, orders a hollow gold en animal, inside of which he is carried into the secret hiding place of the princess. When the statue is damaged it is taken back. In this way the suitor comes out again and is able to describe the way to the princess’s hiding place (to show a token) to the king. Or, the suitor has to recognize the princess among several similar looking girls or animals; the princess helps him by giving a sign [H161, H161.1].

|855       The Substitute Bridegroom. A handsome youth is hired to take the place of a one-eyed (crippled) prince (merchant’s son) at the latter’s wedding. The bride falls in love with the youth and refuses the one- eyed prince [K19.5.3]. In some variants the young man escapes with the bride. Or, the one-eyed prince is tested. He cannot remember the conversation between the bride and the youth on the preceding night [H17]. Sometimes the bride searches for the young man and eventually finds him. She gives alms to all passers-by [H11.1.1], until eventually she recognizes her husband. In other variants the bride offers a reward to all those who tell her a story. The young man appears and tells his story [H11]. Or, the youth has left his name (a verse) with the bride.

|856       The Man with Four Wives (previously  The Girl Elopes With the Wrong Man). A youth is driven away by his father when he states that he will marry four wives [M373]. While acting as a servant, the youth pretends to be unable to read [K1816.0.3]. He is given a message and learns that the princess intends to elope with the son of a court offi cial [K1317.9]. He informs the court official who locks up his son. The youth takes his place and elopes with the princess [K1371.1, N318.2]. At daybreak the princess realizes she cannot return to her par- ents. The young man is bitten by a snake and restored to life [E0] by a girl whom he marries. In the form of a parrot [D638.1, T33] he is bought by another princess, whom he marries as well. Forced to flee, he hides in the house of a rich merchant and marries his daughter. Finally he returns to his father with his four wives. Cf. Type 725.

|859       The Penniless Bridegroom Pretends to Wealth [K1917]. (Including the previous Types 859A–859D and 881**.) A penniless suitor pre tends to be wealthy by boasting and manages to marry the daughter of a rich man. Cf. Types 545D*, 1455, 1459**, 1590, and 1688. This tale exists chiefly in five different forms: (1) A rich man wants to marry his daughter only to a rich man. A poor suitor (sometimes two) pretends to be rich by disguising him self and telling lies to the girl’s father. When the father is ready to marry him to his daughter the suitor burns a wooden tower and pre tends that all his riches have vanished in the fire. Sometimes the bride exposes him by visiting him incognito in his home. (2) After the marriage the bridegroom takes his bride to show her his land. He puts on soiled (patched) clothes. When she looks at the land he points to a patch in his jacket (trousers) saying, “This patch is mine!” [K1917.1]. (Often combined with [3].) (Previously Type 859A.) (3) An uncle wants a wife for his nephew. He gives the boy a coin and food to hold while he makes the arrangement. He tells the girl’s father that his nephew has money in his hand and plenty to eat. So he wins the girl [K1917.2]. (Often combined with [2].) (Previously Type 859B.) (4) When a servant boasts that his house has 150 lights and a goat- pen, his master marries his daughter to him. Arriving at his home they realize that the lights are the stars shining through the cracks in the roof and one goat is tied to a tree [K1917.4]. (Previously Type 859C.) (5) A suitor touches his whiskers saying, “All of these are mine!”, whereupon the girl thinks he is referring to the fields and livestock which they are riding past [K1917.7]. (Previously Type 859D.)

|870        The Princess Confined in the Mound. (Including the previous Types 870C* and 888*.) Because of her faithfulness to her betrothed (separ- a tion of the lovers by a quarrel or a war), a princess (along with her maid servant, sister) is confined by her father in an underground prison (cave, hollow hill, cellar, tower) [R45]. After many (seven) years she escapes [R211] and enters service in the king’s (father of her lover) castle [K1816.0.2, K1831] (without being recognized). She finds her lover about to marry another (witch, pregnant woman). (She works as lady’s maid for the prince’s new bride.) In order to conceal the pregnancy [K1843.1] (because of the hid- eousness or sickness of the bride) the heroine is asked to take her place on wedding day. On the way to the church she talks to her horse [H13.1], to the bridge, and to the church-door [H13.2], and thus reminds the prince of his first love. After the wedding he gives her different objects or she loses things which the second bride had given to her (glove, muffler, neck lace, ring, belt) [H151.5]. The prince picks everything up. When in the eve- ning the prince tests his wife’s identity by demanding that she repeat their conversation on the way to church [H15.1] she can not recall it without consulting the maidservant. When he demands to see the necklace [H92] (when he asks for the objects he had col lected), the truth comes to light. He sends the second woman away and marries his faithful princess [K1911.3]. Cf.

When he is about to marry a bride in accordance with his rank, the poor girl takes the place of his new bride in the marriage bed [K1843.1]. The prince discovers the substitution (by the ornaments given to her [H90] or by a stone indicating chastity [H411.1]), but never theless he accepts the poor scorned girl as his wife. Cf. Types 403, 533, 870, 874, and 879. In the oldest variant from the northern area, a goose-girl declares to a prince that she intends to marry him even if he refuses. When the prince finds a bride of his own rank, the goose-girl warns her about a stone which will reveal her past sexual experiences. The bride asks the goose-girl to substitute for her during the wedding night. Never- theless the stone reveals the truth about the bride’s lost virginity and the prince finally accepts the goose-girl as his true bride. In the southern variants, a neighbor’s daughter believes (because of a prophecy) that she will marry a bey (shah, prince). When he learns about her idea he mocks her. When he marries a woman of his own rank the neighbor’s daughter is asked to substitute for the bride on the wedding night, because the bride had run away (was ugly or was not a virgin). Through special signs he discovers the de cep tion and finally accepts the neighbor’s daughter as his legal wife.

|874       The Proud King is Won. A woman (princess, the youngest of three daughters) falls in love with a king (prince) whom she knows only from hearsay. She writes to him (has a letter or message sent by her father). But the king scorns and rejects her. (When she tells him that she weeps for him, he sends her a handkerchief; when she tells him that she intends to hang herself, he sends her a rope; when she threat ens to commit suicide, he sends her a knife or dagger.) She takes revenge by humiliating him. She arranges to become one of his slaves. After he falls in love with her, she proves who she is by showing him the objects he had given to her. They are recon- ciled and marry. Cf. Types 870A, 879, and 891A.

|875          The Clever Farmgirl [J1111.4]. This type combines various introduc- tory episodes with a common main part.    Introductions:    (1) A king looks for a wife and/or meets a clever girl by chance .    (2) The father of the girl finds a golden mortar in a field and, against the advice of his clever daughter, takes it to the king who demands the pestle as well [H561.1.2].    (3) A quarrel between a farmer and a nobleman in court is settled by giving both riddles to be solved [H630–H659]. The daughter of the farmer gives the right answers [H561.1, H583.7, H583.9, H641.1, H631.3, H632, H633, H636, H583.8].    (4) A king finds a girl in a house. When he asks her about her rela tives she answers with wit and cleverness.    Main part:    The clever girl has to perform various tasks set by the king [H373, H712, H1050–H1055, H1057, H1058, H1061–H1065, H1010, H1022.1, H1024.1, H1024.1.1, H1021.6.1, H1021.1, H1023.9, H1023.7, H1023.1, H951, J1191.2, H1152.1, H1185, H601]: she must come to the king neither naked nor clad, neither by horse nor on foot. She should estimate the value of the king’s beard or weave a cloth with only a few threads. Or she has to make boiled eggs hatch [J1191.2, H1023. 1.1] (cf. Type 821B) or carve a fowl and give appropriate pieces to all members of the family (cf. Type 1533).    The king marries the girl [L162] but orders her not to meddle in his affairs. When he settles a dispute between two farmers unjustly, she advises the wronged man to show the king the absurdity of his decision by an equally foolish act [J1191.1].    When the king casts her out and allows her only to take with her the one thing she holds dearest [J1545.4], she takes her sleeping husband with her and thus moves him to forgive her.  

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 875A, 921, 922, and also 821B, 875B, 875D, 875E, 876, 879, 920, 920A,  
958, and 1533. 
Remarks: The motifs of hatching boiled eggs and of sowing boiled seed probably  
come from Type 821B.

|875A      Girl’s Riddling Answer Betrays a Theft. (Including the previous Type 873*.) A prince sends his servant to a clever girl with a round tart, thirty cakes, and a capon, and asks the girl if it is the full moon, if it is the thirtieth of the month, and if the rooster has crowed in the evening. She replies that it is not full moon, that it is the fifteenth of the month and that the rooster has gone to the mill; but that the prince should spare the pheasant for the partridge’s sake. She thus shows him that the servant has stolen half the tart, half of the cakes, and the capon [H582.1.1].

The contents and combinations of the impossible tasks and their countertasks vary in the numerous variants of this type, where a person imposes an impossible task on someone who, in return, imposes an equally absurd countertask. (1) A prince (king) makes an impossible demand [H1010]: Three unwed girls (virgins) should all give birth to a child at the same time (within nine months). Being summoned to the palace they present themselves disguis ed as pregnant women by hiding cushions under their dresses. When they are granted a wish, the youngest sister asks for roasted snow [H951, J2121]. Being unable to produce it, the prince realizes the absurdity of his own demand and marries the girl. (2) A king imprisons an adviser and will release him only on the condition that he brings a horse that is neither black nor white, neither gray nor reddish brown. The adviser claims to have such a horse at home, but the king cannot fetch it on any day of the week. The king sees the absurdity of his own demand and releases his prisoner. (3) A prince finds a block of white marble so beautiful that he orders his tailor to sew him a suit out of the stone [H1021.9]. No tailor in the kingdom can do this and he orders them all to be killed. Finally an elderly tailor is asked to make the suit. On the advice of his granddaughter he asks the prince for meat made of mud and a cake of snow for lunch. Thus he points to his master’s own absurd task, whereupon the prince recognizes his mistake and marries the granddaughter. (4) A  king  orders  his  adviser  (boy)  to  bring  him  bull’s  milk [H1024.1] or to have a bull bear a calf. The adviser’s daughter pre- tends that her father has given birth to a child [H1024.1.1.1, J1533] and the king thus sees the absurdity of his order. (Previously Type 875B1.) (5) A Muslim king orders his adviser to convert him into a Hindu. The adviser stands by the road rubbing a donkey. When the king

The king thus sees the absurdity of his order [J1536.2]. (Previously Type 875B2 .)  (6) A king orders his adviser to move a well. On the advice of his daughter, the adviser tells the king that the king must help by send ing him the well. The king thus sees the absurdity of his order [H1023. 25.1]. (Previously Type 875B .)                                             3  (7) The king asks a farmer for a tribute of calves born to bulls. The farmer’s son replies, “Let me go and ask my father who is guard ing the fields, lets fish come up from the seashore and eat the millet”. (Previously Type 875B4 .)  (8) Other impossible tasks that occur in some variants are: grow- ing onions out of a stone, winding a rope of chaff [H1021.2] (cf. Type 1174), making a rope of sand [H1021] (cf. Type 1174), counting the leaves of the flowers or the stars in the sky, measuring the sky, sew ing a millstone, drying snow on the stove [J2121, cf. Type 1270], dry ing a candle [J2122] (cf. Type 1270). Cf. Types 1172, 1271A*.

|875D       The Clever Young Woman at the End of the Journey. She explains various enigmatic statements and actions encountered by people on the way [H586, H586.1–H586.7]. Finally she succeeds in a contest in repartee and in performing impossible tasks.  A (dried) fish laughs in the palace [D1318.2.1]. The king orders his vizier (a man) on pain of death to find out why (to solve another problem). The vizier (his son) sets out on a journey. He meets an old man and makes various enigmatic suggestions (two men travel together and one makes enigmatic suggestions). “Let us carry one another”, means, “Let us tell stories to shorten the way”. – “Let us get horses in the forest”, means, “Let us cut walking sticks”. Or, one man does seemingly absurd things e.g. he wears his shoes in the streams and carries them on dry land. The man’s daughter correctly interprets the enigmatic remarks or the seemingly absurd actions [H586]. Finally the vizier’s son mar ries the girl because she answers the original question [H561.1. 1.1]: The fish laughed because there was a man dressed in woman’s clothes in the harem.

|875E       The Unjust Decision: The Oil Press Gives Birth to a Foal. A traveler ties his mare to an oilman’s mill. During the night the mare gives birth to a foal. The oilman claims it, saying the mill (vehicle, pale, crutch ed stick) has given birth to the foal. Or, a rich neighbor claims a calf (from his poor neighbor, who owns the cow) saying that his ox had given birth to it. The judge (jackal) has to decide the case. He arrives late, explaining that the sea was burning and that he had to put the fire out with straw (other absurd explanations). Thus the absurdity of the oilman’s claim be- comes clear (and the traveler may keep the foal) [J1191]. Cf. Types 821B, 875, 920A, and 1804B.

|875*         The Women of Weinsberg. When Weinsberg is besieged, the king per- mits the women to leave and to take with them whatever they can carry (whatever is dearest to them [J1545.4]). Each woman car ries her (sleeping, drunken) husband out of the city. When the sol diers see what is happening, they try to prevent it. They appeal to the king. He appreciates the women’s clever plan and declares that his promise to the women must be kept [J1545.4.1]. Cf. Type 875.

Then, each night, he takes a new wife and has her killed the following day (after she gives birth) (cf. Type 1426). After three years (one year) the vizier is unable to find a suitable woman, so the king condemns him to death.     The vizier’s daughter volunteers to marry the king (although her father objects). She tells stories to the king (with the help of her sister, or a courtier tells the stories) [J1185.1]. The king postpones the execution. After ayear of storytelling (after the wife gives birth), the king realizes that it would be wrong to kill this woman.

The prince’s stepmother makes advances to her stepson, and then accuses him to his father [K2111], who condemns the prince to death. The seven wise men and the queen argue the case by telling stories for seven days [J1185]. In some variants the prince (on advice of his tutors) proves to his father, that one of the queen’s maidservants is a man dressed as a woman [K1836]. The queen and her lover are hanged (and the prince’s innocence is proved).

|877       The Old Woman Who Was Skinned. (La Vecchia Scorticata.) An ugly old maid succeeds in marrying her old and ugly sister to a king (prince) who wants to marry a young woman. In order to hide the ugliness of his bride, she shows the prince only her fingers through the key-hole and the sound of her voice. On the wedding night he discovers the deception and throws the bride out of the window where she is caught in a tree. Some fairies ob serve this and laugh at the dangling old woman. The fairies, grate- ful for the amusement they have had, recompense the old wom an by rejuvenating her into a beautiful girl [D1880]. The king marries her. Being jealous of her sister’s fortune, the other old maid asks her how she became young. The latter, fearing another ruse of her sis- ter’s, explains that she has been skinned. She advises her sister have a barber skin her (the sister has herself skinned and dies).

The prince does not know the answer and continues on his way asham ed. The next day he returns masked as a merchant (fisherman) and sells something precious to the girl in return for a kiss. Or, the prince repeatedly pricks the girl with a needle; she com- plains of insect bites. The next day the prince mocks the girl or re- veals the deceit (the kiss and the pricking) to her. Next the girl dis- guises herself as a doctor [K1837] (death, angel of death), pays a visit to the prince who is feeling sick, and mistreats (mocks) him or makes him believe that death has come to him. Disguised as merchant the girl sells something to the prince on the condition that he kisses his donkey under the tail (his horse’s leg). The prince marries the girl, intending to avenge himself by kill ing her on the wedding night. But she puts a life-sized doll made of sugar (syrup) in her place [K525.1] and hides herself under the bed. When the prince destroys the doll with a sword-thrust and acci dentally tastes its sweet “blood”, he regrets his deed. (The girl comes out of her hiding place and they are reconciled to one another.)

|879A      Fisher Husband of the Princess. A princess falls in love with a very beautiful fisherman’s son and wants to marry him. The boy, worried about his low social standing, warns her that if she ever reproaches him for his social status, he will never talk again. On the wedding night the princess mocks him for his clumsy manners. He leaves her immediately and takes employment at the king’s court. The king, impressed by his beauty, regrets that he can- not speak and promises a reward to whoever succeeds in making him talk again; failure will be punished by death. The princess comes disguised as a man (doctor). For three nights she tries in vain to cure him [H1194.0.1] and is finally led to the gal- lows. The boy (her husband), who is one of the spectators at her exe cution, speaks to her (in a very degrading way) at the very last mo ment and so saves her life. Cf. Types 434, 514, 514**, and 884.

|881       Oft-Proved Fidelity. A merchant marries (falls in love with) a woman (princess) of high descent (extraordinary beauty). During the ab sence of her husband (on a journey), another man (relative, several men) tries to seduce her [K2112] but is rejected. The man slanders her to her husband. He believes the false evidence that she was unfaithful during his absence and orders that she be killed. She asks to be left in a box in the sea, and escapes. A doctor (another man) heals her and wants to marry her (she is found by other men who all want to marry her) [T320.1]. Through her cleverness she eludes or escapes from all the men who (fall in love with her and) want to possess her. After these adventures she disguises herself as a man [K1837] and becomes king. She has her picture (painting, photo, statue) dis played in a public place [H21] (a personal report is published, her life-story is written on a vault). Every person who comments on the picture is imprisoned. All the men she had known during her life, her husband in  cluded, come (to the picture) and describe their meeting with her. The woman  in man’s clothes condemns, pardons, or recompenses them according to the roles they played in her life. Finally she discloses her identity and is reunited with (marries) her husband [R195]. (She changes roles with her husband so that he becomes ruler.) Cf. Types 514, 514**, 712, 880, 884, and 887.

|881A      The Abandoned Bride Disguised as a Man. A prince and his bride are separated in a forest. She escapes from her would-be seducers [T320. 1]. (She shoots an arrow, saying she will marry the one who first re turns with it, and escapes while the men pursue the arrow.) The bride disguises herself as a man [K521.4.1.1, K1837] and is chosen king (given other high honors in a strange land). Or she dis- guises herself as a servant to the king and overpowers an ogress. (She hears a cry at night and finds an ogress trying to devour a hu man corpse. She cuts off the ogress’s leg or the like and is rewarded by the king.) She “marries” a princess (princesses) [K1322]. She displays her picture (statue) in a public place [H21] and posts servants (stays there herself) to overhear comments. She gives alms to all comers. In this way she finds her husband. The would-be seducers are punished. Cf. Types 514**, 881.

|882          The Wager on the Wife’s Chastity. (Cymbeline.) A husband (ship captain) praises the virtue of his wife (poor girl) and makes a wager with a friend (business partner, merchant, adversary) regarding her chastity [N15]. After trying in vain to seduce the woman, the friend, with the help of a corrupt servant, secretly goes into her bedroom (hidden in a box) [K1342]. There, without touching her, he discovers a birthmark on her breast and/or secures a token (ring [H94] or cloth ing) and uses it to pretend that he seduced her [K2112.1]. The husband believes him, casts off his wife (orders someone to kill her),  and leaves home.     The woman escapes death and travels in man’s clothes [K1837]. She gains a high position at a foreign court. There she meets her hus- band, who has become destitute and proves her innocence to him.     In some variants she follows her husband and serves him un- recognized (in man’s clothes) for several years. Finally the slan derer is unmasked and the couple is reunited. Cf. Type 892.

|883A      The Innocent Slandered Maiden. (Including the previous Type 883C*.) In the absence of her father (parents), a relative (friend, clergy man, guardian) attempts to seduce a young woman. When she rejects him [T320.1], he writes a slanderous letter (out of re venge) to her father accusing her of loose conduct [K2110.1, K2112]. The father commands his son to kill his sister [S322.1.3]. Out of pity (believing in her innocence) the brother spares her and gives the liver (heart, blood) of an animal [K512.2] to the king as proof of the murder. The girl is abandoned. A king (prince) finds her and marries her [L162]. When the king has to go to war (when the woman with her children wants to pay a visit to her father), he tells a servant (officer, soldier, dignitary) or a relative (brother, uncle) to take care of (accompany) his wife. A second attempt at seduction is made [K2250.1], and the woman’s children are often killed. She escapes [T320] in man’s clothes (dis- guised as soldier, officer or shepherd) [K1837] and works unre cog- nized as a servant in her father’s house (in an inn, as a shepherd). Despite the slanderer’s statement that the queen is dead (abduct ed, escaped, has murdered her children), the king searches for his wife (father searches for his daughter). Finally all persons concerned meet together and the woman in man’s clothes tells them what had hap-

|883B       The Punished Seducer. Before going on a journey, a man (merchant) locks up his three daughters, and gives each of them a magic object (ring [D1610.8], flowers [D1610.3]) that will indicate if they are un- chaste. A prince (knight, three princes, three young men) enters the girls’ room secretly (disguised as a merchant) and seduces the two elder ones. The clever youngest sister resists his attempt at seduction [L63] and teases the prince. When her sisters have given birth, she dis- guises herself as a beggar and carries the newborn children to the princes’ castle (to their fathers). When the merchant comes home and realizes what has happened, he intends to kill the two sisters. (But when the princes agree to marry his daughters he abandons his plan). The prince who wants to marry his youngest daughter plans to kill her on her wedding night. She puts a sugar doll in her place [K525.1]. He cuts the doll with his sword, and when he tastes the “blood” he realizes “the sweetness” of his wife and regrets his deed. (The girl shows up and they are reconciled with one another.) Cf.

|887       Griselda. A marquis (king) who loves his freedom marries because his subjects demand it. He chooses a wife of the lower class (named Griselda), and demands that she promise always to be obedient. When she has given birth to two children, he tests her obedience by taking them away making her believe that he has killed them. After 15 years, he casts her off and orders her adult children (who had grown up in another family) to come home. He pretends to marry Griselda’s daughter, and makes Griselda serve her at the wed- ding feast. When Griselda accepts even this humiliation, he ex plains every thing to her (that everything had been a test), and takes her again as his wife [H461]. Cf. Types 712, 881, and 900.

|888       The Faithful Wife. (Including the previous Type 875C.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man who is taken into slavery in Turkey [R61] wears a shirt that remains white as long as his wife at home remains true to him [H431.1]. The sultan sends a messenger to seduce the wife, but in vain [T320.1]. Disguised as a pilgrim (monk) [K1837], she reaches the sultan’s court. Through her harp-playing and her singing she wins the sul- tan’s favor. He presents her with a (three) Christian slave, who is in fact her husband [R152.1]. When the husband has returned home he wonders what happened to his wife. She arrives in her pilgrim dress and identifies herself as his rescuer. (2) A king goes to a foreign land, where he is thrown into prison. His wife disguises herself as a gusli-player [K1837], goes to the hos- tile king and receives his permission to take one of the prisoners with her. She chooses her husband [J1545.4]. The husband does not recognize her and later reproaches his wife for not trying to help him. The truth is discovered. (Previously Type 875C.)

|888A       The Wife Who Would Not be Beaten. A prince (merchant’s son) says he will marry only a woman who will submit to a beating each day [M134]. When he is married his wife refuses to allow him to beat her, saying he does not support her (but her father does). The prince sets out to win his fortune but is enslaved (loses all his fortune, must work at menial tasks). His wife disguises herself as a man [K1837] and frees him (by winning back all he had lost) [J1545. 6]. She wins chess games by releasing mice which are chased by a trained cat (cf. Type 217) (she tricks the cheaters, she wins the wager). She secures tokens from her husband. At home, when the husband falsely boasts of his exploits, the wife displays the tokens [H80]. Her husband never beats her again.

|889       Wager on the Faithfulness of the Servant (previously The Faithful Serv ant). A man (king, lord, farmer) boasts that his servant (shep- herd, farmhand) would never tell a lie. His neighbor (foreign king, visitor, friend, governor) makes a wager on the faithfulness of the servant [N25]. In order to test the servant he is sent with a letter to the neighbor’s wife (queen, daughter) where the woman makes him drunk and seduces him. In some variants the maidservant (daughter, wife) is sent to the sherpherd and persuades him to give her in return for her favors a lamb or the golden horns (liver, skin, meat) of his master’s best ox (sheep, horse). Or he is made to believe that he lost his master’s pro perty by gambling while drunk. Later the servant rehearses how he could justify his behavior to his master: He puts his stick into the earth with his hat on top and speaks to it. But all possible lies seem inadequate to him, so he de- cides to tell the truth [J751.1]. Thus his master wins the wager (the servant is rewarded for his honesty). Cf. Type 930.

|890       A Pound of Flesh. A contract entitles the lender (Jew, merchant, usurer,  nobleman) of a sum of money (that has been used to woo or to buy a woman [T52.3]) to cut a pound of flesh (eye, head, single limbs) from the debtor’s (Christian or Muslim merchant, goldsmith, Jew,

In some variants the husband goes abroad for some time, and other men try to seduce his wife. She deceives them all and takes their money in payment for keeping the matter secret [K443.2] (cf. Types 882A*, 1730). When the time limit has been reached, the case is brought to the judge (pope, king, sultan, the debtor’s wife disguised as judge [K1825.2], another woman in man’s clothes [K1837]). In some variants, before the judgment has been executed, the cre- ditor is offered the money if he will forgo the pound of flesh, but he does not agree. The judgment formally favors the creditor but adds some impossible conditions: when cutting the flesh of the debtor he must take the exact amount (he must not shed blood), otherwise he will be punished severely. Thereupon the creditor re nounces his demand to mutilate the debtor (and is punished in addition).

A man (prince, merchant) marries a woman, intending to revenge himself for an in- sult. He deserts her untouched before the wedding night (im prisons her), and sets her the seemingly impossible task of bearing him a son [H1187] (to get a foal of his mare or to fill a sealed box with gold) and leaves her. She follows him in disguise (first in man’s clothes [K1837]) and has a love-affair with him without being recognized (three times) [K1814]. She gives birth to a son (three children). Her husband returns, intending to marry another woman. Upon seeing her son (children, tokens) he realizes that she has fulfilled the task. They are reconciled and he sends the other woman away. Cf.

|894       The Ghoulish Schoolmaster and the Stone of Pity. (Including the pre- vious Types 437 and 707A.) A princess accidentally sees her school - master eating a corpse (a human being) [G11.9]. She escapes. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A princess marries a prince abroad and gives birth to several children, who are kidnapped by the ghoulish teacher. The teacher leaves blood (other signs) that point at the mother as murderer of her children [K2155.1], she is imprisoned. When the prince goes on a journey, his imprisoned wife asks him to bring her a stone of patience (and a knife), which he does. The prince overhears his wife telling her sorrows to the stone [H13.2.2]. The stone swells and finally bursts because it cannot bear the sorrow (and she tries to kill herself with the knife). The prince embraces his innocent slandered wife, and the cannibal teacher brings back her children. (2) The princess finds a sleeping prince who can only be awakened  if she would care for him for a certain period (seven years, seven months, seven days [Z72.2]). Just before the end of the time limit, the princess delegates her task to a female slave and falls asleep. When the prince awakens and sees the slave he thinks that she has saved his life. He marries her, and the princess becomes her maidservant [K2251.1, K1911.1.4]. The princess asks for a knife and a stone of patience. The king’s marshal overhears her telling her story to the swelling stone. When the prince listens, the stone bursts out of pity [H13.2.2]. When she is about to kill herself with the knife, the prince interferes. They marry and the slave girl is punished.

|896       The Lecherous Holy Man and the Maiden in a Box. A holy man (trusted  adviser) falls in love with a beautiful girl, but she spurns his advances. He convinces the girl’s father (husband) that she is un chaste (will bring calamities to the kingdom) and that she should be placed in a box and cast into the river (delivered to him). He in- structs his followers to bring the box to him, to leave it in his room, to securely lock the doors, and to ignore any sounds that may come from his room [K1333, K1367]. A prince (other helper) finds the box before it falls into the hands of the holy man’s followers, removes the girl, and puts a mad dog (tiger, wild animal) [K1625, K1674] into the box. The holy man is torn to pieces when he opens the box [Q243.6]. The girl marries her rescuer and is reconciled with her family.

|897       The Orphan Girl and Her Cruel Sisters-in-Law. A young girl is left by her seven brothers while they go on a trip in the care of her seven sisters-in-law. They set tasks for her [H934.2], hoping she will be unable to perform them so that they can punish her. She is helped by various animals: to carry a large load of sticks from the forest without using a rope, a helpful snake winds around the sticks [H1023.19, B579.5]; to fetch a tigress’s milk [H1361.1], the tigress willingly gives it; to fetch water in a sieve [H1023.2] (cf. Type 1180), frogs fill the holes in the sieve [H1023.2.1.2]; to gather seeds scattered in a field, birds help her [H1091.2]. While she is performing the last task, the brothers appear. The sisters-in-law are punished.

|898       The Daughter of the Sun. (The Speechless Maiden. The Doll Bride.) In order to evade a prophecy that a princess would be impregnated by the sun and bear a child, she is confined in a tower. Nevertheless the prophecy is fulfilled [T381, T521]. The daughter of the sun is ex- posed [S313] in a garden and rescued by a prince [R131.1.3]. In some variants a childless couple, after having a dream, build them selves a girl (doll) from wood (lime, paste). A prince wants to marry her. On the way to the prince the (mistress of the) sea ex- changes the doll with her own daughter, whom the prince marries. The prince does not recognize her extraordinary origin, so she stays mute and rejects him. The prince marries three women of royal blood, but they all die when they try to imitate the abilities of the first woman (e.g. objects obey her commands, her cut nose grows again, when she puts her finger in hot oil cooked fish appear, etc.). When the prince feigns an illness the girl cares for him, reveals her origin, and consents to the marriage. In other variants the prince overhears objects quarreling and learns how he should address her: daughter of the sun (daughter of the sea, etc.). When he calls her in this way she speaks and marries him.

|899      Alcestis. A young man (only son) is doomed to an early death: He is predestined to die on his wedding day [M341.1.1]. In some variants Norns [M301.12] (an angel, death) predict his death for the third day after his birth (another day). God (saints, St. George, Demetrius) intercedes with the Norns (death), and they agree that the young man may live if another person is willing to die for him or to give him half (a part) of his own remaining lifetime. The members of his family (his parents) refuse, but his bride is ready to die for him [T211.1]. God saves both the young man and the woman who is willing to sacrifice herself, and punishes the hard- hearted parents. Cf. Types 934, 1354.

|899A     Pyramus and Thisbe. Pyramus and Thisbe, children of neighboring families, are in love, but their fathers have forbidden them to meet. They use a crack in the wall between their houses to communicate in secret [T41.1]. One day they decide to meet on the following night outside the city under a mulberry tree. When Thisbe arrives she is frightened by a lion and hides in a cave. Before the lion goes away, he chews on a scarf that Thisbe had dropped, and leaves marks of blood on it. Pyramus comes and, seeing the scarf (other evidence), believes that Thisbe is dead and kills himself [N343]. Thisbe returns, finds her lover dead, and kills herself with his sword [T81.6]. The blood-red berries of the mulberry tree commem- o  rate the lovers’ unhappy end.

|900        King Thrushbeard. A princess refuses all (one) who come to her as suitors [H311] without giving a reason. She ridicules them and calls them ugly names (Thrushbeard) [T74.0.1, T76]. Her father, angry at this behavior, decides that she has to marry the next man who comes [T62], even if he is a beggar. The last rejected wooer decides to take revenge. He appears dis- guised as a beggar [K1816.0.3, K1817.1] (in arrangement with her father) and the princess is forced into marriage [T72.2.1] (the beggar purchases the right to spend three nights with her [T45, K1361]; she becomes pregnant). The couple runs away (is banished by the king). On the way the prince in disguise humilates his new wife. She has to beg and sell in the marketplace, she has to work in the kitchen of his own castle and he even forces her to steal [L113.1.0.1, L431, H465, Q483, H461, T251. 2]. During a celebration (supposedly the wedding of the once reject ed prince) he, in his true character as prince, exposes her as a thief before all the people at court. Only then does he reveal himself to her as her beggar husband [H181]. He forgives her for her haugh- tiness and their official wedding is celebrated. Cf. Type 900C*.

|900C*     The Half-Pear. A princess is to be married to whoever wins a tourna- ment. She mocks a knight who eats half a pear without peeling it (and without offering her the other half) calling him, “Knight of the half-pear”. He disguises himself as a deaf-mute fool and lies down before the palace. He is invited to sit at the fireplace inside the palace. When his penis becomes erect he is summoned by the princess and has sexual intercourse with her. The next day he is thrown out and returns to the tournament in his former knight’s dress where he alludes clearly to the night’s events. He marries the embarrassed princess. Cf. Type 900.

|902*       The Lazy Woman is Cured. (Including the previous Type 1371**.) A lazy woman does not perform her household work (she deceives her husband by pretending to have finished it). She always shows her husband the same spool of thread, until one day she has only one dirty (no) dress left. Her husband takes her (naked) enveloped in a bundle of straw (animal skin) to a wedding (festivity) [Q495.1]. The bundle (animal skin) falls apart and the woman stands naked before the public [Q495]. Thus she is cured of her laziness and becomes industrious from then on. In some variants the woman wears a very dirty dress or is naked. When she sees her husband coming back from the market, she thinks he is bringing a new shirt for her, but instead of a shirt he is carrying a white goose in his arms [W111.3.1]. (Previously Type 1371**.) Cf. Types 1370, 1405, 1453.

|910A      The Father’s Precepts Disregarded (previously Wise Through Experi- ence). (Including the previous Types 910J and 911*.) A dying man gives three precepts to his son (to another person) [J154]. Each vari ant includes three of the following precepts: (1) Never tell a secret to a woman [J21.22]. (2) Do not make friends with (trust) a policeman [J21.46] (soldier [J21.46], ruler [J21.28]). (3) Do not plant a thorny tree (without permission) on your prop- erty [J21.52]. (4)  Do  not  adopt  a  child  [J21.27]  (godchild,  orphan,  child  of thief). (5) Do not visit your friends (parents) too often [J21.9]. (6) Avoid the house of a red-bearded man. Cf. Type 1588**. (7) Do not marry a woman from abroad [J21.4] (be careful in your choice of a wife). (8) Do not let your wife go to a wedding accompanied only by her parents (do not let her go for a long visit to her parents) [J21.47.1]. (9) Do not bargain for your horse [J21.26], do not make it run down a hill [J21.24]. (10) Do not lend your horse [J21.10]. 

FFC 284                           Realistic Tales (Novelle)                              529 The son (person) disregards his father’s precepts (he thinks they are nonsensical) and suffers misfortune (in order to test the precepts, he acts against them). (1) After burying (hiding) an animal (human being) at a special place he tells his wife about it. When they quarrel and he beats her, she calls him a murderer and he is arrested. (2) His friend arrests him without listening to the true version of the event (he condemns him by jumping to conclusions without iden ti fying the victim). (3) His turban sticks in the thorns of a tree, and his friend forces him to present himself without it. (The thorn tree he planted causes for a quarrel with a neighbor to whom he has to pay compensa- tion.) (4) His adoptive son is willing to execute him, when an execu- tioner is not available. (5) His hosts are annoyed by his numerous visits and offer him bad meals (mindful of his father’s advice, he keeps a sample). (6) He passes the night in a forbidden house (where a red-haired man lives). After taking a short-cut, he finds himself in a den of thieves. He escapes (with the help of a servant whom he later mar- ries). (7) He finds out that the woman he intends to marry has a lover (he keeps his trousers as evidence). (8) He lets his wife go to a wedding with her family and her new-born child. Disguised himself as a Turk, he meets her and tries to seduce her and takes her son away. His mother-in-law sets fire to the house and says that the child was killed in the fire. The husband re turns the child and forgives his wife. (9) Nobody wants to buy his horse because the price is too high. It falls sick (is injured) and dies (he keeps the skin as evidence). (10) His mare, which his friend had borrowed, dies from over- work. When his friend apologizes for his mistake he forgives him. Finally he realizes that his father’s precepts were indeed wise. (1) Just before he is arrested, he shows the judge where to find the victim. (2) To his astonishment, it is an animal. (3) It turns out that the missing person (animal) is still alive. (4) He explains that he had only intended to test the precepts of his father. (5) He is immediately freed and prosecutes the persons who tried to harm him. (6) He invites his bride and his parents to his home. (7) He explains to them the significance of the souvenirs of his errors. (8) He casts off his bride.

|910B      The Observance of the Master’s Precepts (previously The Servant’s Good Counsels). (Including the previous Type 910H.) A poor man who cannot provide for his family takes service with a rich farmer for one year for a certain amount of money. After he has completed his service, the farmer gives him his choice of the agreed wages or a good precept. The man chooses the precept: “Always follow the main road” [J21.5]. Disappointed by this he hires on for a second and then a third year after which he is given various precepts: “Mind your own busi ness” [J21.6] or “Do not sleep where a young woman is married to an old man” [J21.3] and “Always postpone your anger until the next day” [J21.2]. (For other examples see the numerous subdivisions in the Motif-Index [J21ff.].) Feeling discouraged the poor man gets ready to go home. His

At a fork in the road the poor man follows the farmer’s advice and takes the old main road instead of a shorter new one [J21.5]. He later learns that he would have been waylaid by robbers on the new road [N765, J865]. At dusk he reaches a house where he spends the night. There he sees strange events, but he does not interfere [J21.6]. When he is about to leave, his host calls him back and rewards him with a large sum of money for his discretion (indiscretion would have brought death to the host’s wife [D700, D758]). After he has refused to sleep in a house where a young woman is married to an old man [J21.3], he witnesses a murder [K2213.3]. When an innocent man, who spent the night at the woman’s house, is condemned for the murder, he testifies to the man’s innocence [K2155]. When the poor man finally reaches home and looks through a window, he sees a stranger kissing his wife. He intends to kill the man, but fortunately postpones his anger at the last moment [J21.2, J571]. The stranger was his own grown son. When the family gathers around the table to celebrate their reunion, the poor man cuts the bread and finds all the money he had earned hidden inside [Q20.2].

|910C      Think Carefully Before You Begin a Task. In the market (public place ) a young man (king, prince) meets an old (wise) man in a shop where  “wisdom” is told instead of goods. The old man explains to the won- dering young man that the “wisdom” he sells would be very useful for ruling people. The young man decides to buy a precept for five coins. The old man gives him the following maxim: “Whatever you do, do wisely and think of the consequences” [J21.1] and he adds that if the young man will follow the precept he will become the most powerful person in the whole kingdom. Upon his father’s death the young man becomes king and orders that the maxim be displayed on all the walls of the palace. When enemies bribe his barber to cut the king’s throat while shaving him, he reads the maxim at the last moment. Afraid of the possible conse- quences, he confesses his intention (and desists from his plan). The value of the precept is recognized.

|910D      The Treasure Behind the Nail (previously The Treasure of the Hang ing Man). When he dies, a rich merchant advises his spendthrift son that if ever he spends his entire fortune, he should hang himself from a special nail (beam, hook) [J21.15]. After his father dies, the son wastes his inheritance with his friends  until he has nothing left. When he tries to hang himself in despair, the nail tears out of the wall and a treasure, which his father had hidden there, falls down [N545.1]. From then on the young man leads a virtuous life (pays his debts). Cf. Type 740**.

After his death his children dig everywhere and thus loosen the soil of the vineyard. They do not find any treasure but the vineyard becomes very fruit ful. (Then they understand their father’s advice.) [H588.7].

|910F      The Quarreling Sons and the Bundle of Twigs. A man (king, farmer) explains to his (quarreling) sons, that a bundle of twigs (sticks, ar- rows, lances) cannot be broken, whereas separately the pieces are easily broken. Thus he demonstrates the value and the strength of unity. His sons apply the lesson [J1021].

|910K          Walk to the Ironworks (previously The Precepts and the Uriah Let- ter). A dying nobleman who had served a long time at the king’s court asks the king to employ his son. The king agrees and the dying man gives three precepts to his son. First: “Never associate with enviers or slanderers” (“Do not talk about what you have seen” or “Do not dishonor your master’s house with adultery”). Second: “Al- ways sympathize with your master’s fortune and emotions”. Third: “Never pass a church without going inside” (“Never neglect to go to mass”).     When his father has died the young man begins his service at the king’s court. An envious man slanders him and accuses him of de siring the queen. When he, following his father’s advice, starts to weep when the queen weeps, his behavior is interpreted as proof of a love affair and it is decided that he must be killed. His adversary (slanderer) intends to throw him into the blast furnace of the iron- works (limekiln, mine, well, brewery, baking oven) or to kill him by some other means.     He is sent to the place where he is to be killed. Those who are charged with his murder are told to kill the first man who arrives (he brings along a message, a letter commanding his murder [K978] or cer tain object such as a handkerchief or lemon). According to his father’s advice, the young man goes to mass on the way and is de- layed.     His slanderer (adversary), impatient to see him dead, arrives the place before him and is killed instead of him. The innocent young man then reports his slanderer’s death. He is restored to favor, or gains fortune, wealth and honor [K1612]. Cf. Type 930. 

Remarks: The observance of three precepts occurs only in some variants. In  
num erous variants type 910K is combined with 930. A clear distinction between  
the types is often impossible, as several variants belong to both types. Neverthe- 
less 910K and 930 are fundamentally separate types (see EM 5, 663).

|910L      Do Not Drive the Insects Away. This tale exists chiefly in three dif- fer ent forms: (1) A fox crossing a river falls into a crevice and cannot get out. He becomes infested with lice (flies). A hedgehog passing by sees the fox suffering and offers to help. The fox refuses, saying that these lice are already full, and if the hedgehog takes them away, new lice who are even hungrier will come [J215.1]. (2) A sick (injured) man covered with sores is bothered by flies. He refuses any help, saying that hungry flies bite twice as hard as full ones. (3) A merchant is captured by robbers (farmers want to punish a cor rupt mayor or a thievish miller, a landlord wants to punish one of his tenants). They undress him (and cover him with honey) and

A man (knight) offers to drive the insects away, but the merchant refuses, saying that others even worse and more hungry will come in their place. (The farmers set the mayor [miller] free and decide to let him stay in his office, lest someone even greedier would take his place.)

|910N      The Magic Box. A poor farmer (farmwife) complains to his neighbor (clergyman) that his farm is not doing well. The neighbor gives him a box which he says is magic, and tells the farmer to carry it once each day through his house and barn. When the farmer does this, he notices what the problems are and becomes wealthy.     In another version, an older woman tells an incompetent house- wife that she should look all over her house and yard for a white sparrow. As she does this, the housewife puts everything in order and becomes prosperous.

The barber refuses to shave the officer, and so do the two other barbers in the shop. Only the apprentice will agree to this bargain.  All goes well. As the officer leaves, he asks, “Weren’t you afraid?” The apprentice answers, “No. If I had cut you, I would have cut your throat right away with the razor.” Cf. Type 910C.

|912           The Wise Man and the Rain of Fools. During a certain rainy period, everyone on whom the water falls becomes a fool (is compelled to sing and dance). A wise man arrives and sees that all the adults and children have gone crazy. He joins them in their foolery. He asks why they behave thus, and they reply him that it is because of the rain. The wise man tastes some of the rainwater and he also becomes a fool [J1714.2, D1353.1].     In Arabic variants a ruler hears that everyone who came into contact with the rainwater became crazy, so he does not drink it. But when he sees that he no longer holds his former power and au thority, he drinks the water.

|915          All Depends on How You Take It. A widower with a clever, indus- trious daughter marries a widow with a stupid, lazy daughter. When the children are grown and ready to leave home, their mother (father) gives them three indirectly expressed precepts to guide them in their new independence (employment, marriage).     On a visit the mother (parents) realizes that her own daughter has  followed  the  precepts  literally  and  therefore  caused  herself much trouble. Her stepdaughter, however, recognized the underly- ing mean ing of the precepts (often with the help of her father) and therefore everything goes well for her [J555.1]. Cf. Type 915A.

|915A         The Misunderstood Precepts. A dying father (mother) gives indi rectly expressed advice to his son (daughter) (before marriage): “Always eat bread with honey” (means: “Work diligently and your bread will be as sweet as honey”) [H588.11], “God bless you in your labors” (means: “Start your work earlier than others, so that others will greet you thus and not you them”) [H588.12] and “Always wear your shoes” (means: “Walk the fields barefooted, wear your shoes only when near the town”) [H588.13]. When the son follows these pre- cepts literally, he becomes poor. Only later does he learn their real meaning.     Or, the father gives ironic precepts: “Whenever you feel like gambling, do it until your eyes are red and your cheeks are pale”,  “Whenever you feel like drinking, do it until you are drunk and fall asleep”, and “Whenever you desire a woman, go there early in the morning and wake her up”.     Following the precepts he gambles away all his money. Drinking to forget his losses, he feels so ill the next morning that he wants never to drink again. He visits a woman early in the morning and is so scared by her appearence that he runs home. There he thinks about his father’s “bad” precepts that cured him of gambling, drink- ing and womanizing. (Other precepts see H588ff.)

|916       The Brothers Guarding the King’s Bedchamber and the Snake. Sev- eral brothers are hired by a king to guard his bedchamber. The first brother sees a snake in the bedchamber and kills it, but a drop of its poison falls on the queen. While he is wiping the poison, she awakes and accuses him trying to attack her [N342.1] (cf. Type 516). The other brothers tell stories against making a hasty decision. The next morning the truth comes to light. The stories: (1) The innocent dog (cf. Type 178A). (2) The faithful dog as security for a debt (cf. Type 178B). (3) The falcon and the poisoned water (cf. Type 178C). (4) The parrot and the fruit of youth. A parrot brings to a king, his master, some fruit of youth. Unbeknown to the parrot a snake has dropped poison on the fruit. The king gives one of the fruits to a dog which dies, and then slays the parrot [B331.3]. Later the truth comes to light.

Because her young (unborn) son calls his mother a whore [J125.2.1, T575.1], the queen com mands that the child (the young Solomon) be killed [S301]. The child asks the servant for mercy; he is not killed [K512] but raised by a smith. In order that her husband should not discover this deceit, the queen takes the smith’s son as her own [K1921.1]. During their childhood, the two boys play along with others. In their game, Solomon stands out because, playing the part of the king

Or, the smith’s son speaks of farming matters, but Solomon speaks of military af fairs. His father the king (in person or through a messenger) tests the boy’s wisdom with impossible tasks or difficult questions [H921]. Or, the boy (often acting as a shepherd [K1816.6]) makes wise judg ments or observations that reveal his royal origin [H41.5]. His intelli gent answers show him to be the son of the king. Cf. esp. Types 875, 921, and 922. In some variants an additional episode may follow, but more often this is a separate tale: Solomon’s wife elopes with a rival king. Solo- mon goes to retrieve her. He is captured but is permitted to blow his horn three times before his death [K551.3]. This was a pre arranged signal, and his army comes and rescues him. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 875 and 921. 
Remarks: This type includes the ancient theme of the Boy King.

|920A      The Case of the Boiled Eggs (previously The Daughter of the King and the Son of the Peasant). A princess as baby is secretly exchanged by her mother with the son of a farmwife [K1921.1], because the king has threatened to kill her if she does not give birth to a boy. Later the king has to judge a case: A merchant who bought forty eggs before a journey, intends to pay for them after his return. But he is asked to pay for the value of all the chickens and their offspring that would have hatched from the eggs [J1191.2]. The king does not know how to judge the case, and by chance overhears the exchang ed children playing a game, the case of the boiled eggs [H1023.1.1] (cf. Type 821B). The princess plays the role of the king and points out that chickens could never hatch from boiled eggs. The king adopts the girl’s decision [J123]. Finally the children’s identity is discovered and they are reexchanged. Cf. Types 821B, 875, and 875E. 
Remarks: The motif, or the episode, of the comparison of hatching chickens from  
boiled eggs with the sewing of boiled seed was probably adopted from the Jew ish  
tradition (cf. Type 821B).

The third says that he would like to be a bird that flies with many others, so as to receive advice. The king chooses the third son as the next king, because as a ruler he would always seek advice [J412.1].

|920A*     The Inquisitive King. Solomon states that all women could be se- duced (are more stupid than men), even his mother. He proves his state ment by sending a servant to seduce her. In order to test her chastity Solomon disguises himself and goes in place of the servant to the meeting point [N383.3]. When his moth er is about to commit incest with her own son, she realizes the decep- tion and curses him: He cannot die until he has measured the height of the sky and the depth of the sea (before having gone around the earth and to the bottom of the sea). Thereupon Solomon vainly attempts to measure the height of the sky and the depth of the sea [L414.1]. On the back of a bird he flies to the sun, but the bird’s wings are burned and he falls down (eagles take him up to the sky and let him fall down, the curse be- comes true.) He sits inside a box fixed to a chain, and tells a woman to low er it down to the bottom of the sea. Unfortunately a crayfish cuts the chain. In some variants his measuring is successful. On an old woman’s back he rides to the stars, and devils save him from the submerged box. Cf. Types 823A*, 922.

|920B*     The Lineage of the King’s Three Sons. A captive king interrogates the three sons of the king who has captured him as to how they will treat him (he gives them riddles). From their answers he learns their real descent. One of the sons is from a family of executioners (bakers), the other one from butchers, while only the third son is from the royal family.

|920C*     The Choice of a Wife. A young man asks Solomon (another king) for advice about what sort of girl he should marry: one with property, one with money, or a poor one with nothing. Solomon answers, “Go away; you don’t know anything; do whatever you like”. (“Be quiet, I am in charge; get up, so I can sit down; do whatever you like.”). The answers mean accordingly, that the first girl would chase him away because the property belongs to her; the second would tell him that the money is hers and he is ignorant; but the third one will not meddle with anything, even if she is bad tempered.

|921          The King and the Farmer’s Son. A boy (farmer’s son, Solomon) as- ton ishes a king passing by his hut by giving clever answers. The an swers  refer  to  questions  like:  what  do  you  (does  your  father, mother, brother, sister) do? [H583.1–H583.6]. And/or they deal with  a para doxical demand to come to the king under certain conditions [H1050–H1064].    The following questions and answers are most frequent:    (1) What are you doing? I boil those coming and going (I boil peas, beans, and/or lentils that keep rising and falling in the water [H 583.6]).    (2) What is your father doing? He makes a bad thing worse (he blocks a path in a field which causes another to be trodden [H583. 2.1]). Or, he is in the vineyard doing good and bad (he prunes vines but sometimes cuts good ones and leaves the bad [H583.2]). Or, he makes many out of few (he sows grain [H583.2.2]).    (3) What is your mother doing? She does for another what the latter cannot do for herself (she lays out a corpse [H583.4]). Or, she is baking forgotten bread (to pay back borrowed bread [H583.4.2]).    (4) What is your brother doing? He hunts; he throws away what he catches, and what he does not catch he carries home (he hunts for lice on his body [H583.3]).    (5) What is your sister doing? She is mourning last year’s laugh ter (she nurses her child, the fruit of last year’s love affair [H583.5]. Cf. Types 875, 920. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other  
types, esp. 875 and 922B, and also 920, 921F*, and 922. 
Remarks: Type 921 is closely related to Type 875, and the stories are often com- 
bined with each other. In Type 921 the enigmatic answers occur in many more  
versions, which renders the classification under Type 921 and the separation of  
the two types more difficult.

|921A      The Sharing of Bread Or Money (previously Four Coins). A farmer (craftsman) responds to the king’s question, why he is working so hard or how he would use his salary (four coins, bread), by giving enigmatic answers: The first I eat (feed myself), the second I put out at interest (give to my children so that they can care for me when I am old), with the third I pay debts (keep my parents) and the fourth I throw away (give to my wife) [H585.1]. The king asks his ministers to interpret the farmer’s answers for him. When they ask the farmer, he demands a reward for each response. In a medieval version, a smith named Focus, who worked on a feast day despite the emperor’s prohibition, is betrayed by a statue constructed by the magician Virgil. He defends himself by stating that he needs to earn eight coins daily. Two of the coins he has to re pay (to his father), two he has to lend (to his son), two are lost (to be given to his wife) and two are to be spent (for himself).

|921B      Best Friend, Worst Enemy. The central motif of the tale is the follow- ing task: A man should bring his best friend and his worst enemy [H1065]. He fulfills the task by choosing his dog as friend and his wife as enemy. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) When the master orders his servant (Aesop) to bring food to the person who loves him most, the servant serves his dog instead of his wife. The wife feels offended and threatens to leave her husband.  The servant explains that only the dog would really love his mas ter for it would return even if it had been beaten. (2) A young man violates the order that all old people should be killed. He hides his father with the help of his wife. Because of the intrigues of some envious men, the king demands that the young man, on pain of death, bring his servant, his friend (jester) and his enemy to the king. Following his father’s advice he takes his donkey as servant, his dog as friend (his child as jester) and his wife as en- emy. The offended wife reproaches her husband for classifying her in this way after she had helped him hide his father. This be trayal turns her into his enemy and so he accomplishes the task. Cf. Type 981. (3) A young man rescues the devil (stranger, saint, ghost, robber) from a wolf (other danger) whereupon the devil promises pay for the service if the young man will bring his most faithful friend to the meeting. The man comes with his wife. The devil appears in a rich disguise and persuades the wife to kill her husband when he is asleep. Later he promises her marriage and wealth. The woman agrees. When she raises the knife (ax, stone) for the murder, the devil awakens her husband. He says that he has now repaid the man by saving his life, and refuses to pay the recom pense. The man should have brought his dog instead of his wife. (The man must bring his real friend the next day. His dog follows him without being called, attacks the stranger, and proves its faith fulness.) Cf. Type 824.

|921F      Philosopher Spits in the King’s Beard. A philosopher is invited to dine with the king. During the meal he is obliged to spit and does so in the king’s beard. The servants become indignant and want to beat him, but the king insists on asking the philosopher [J152] why he did such a thing. The philosopher answers that everything else around him was silk or gold, so the king’s beard was the most suitable place for spit- ting. The king accepts this explanation [J1566.1].

|921B*     Thief, Beggar, Murderer. A nobleman (emperor, clergyman) observes an old farmer laboriously plowing his field. Asked if he has no sons who can help him, the old man answers that he has three university- trained sons, one is a thief (robber, liar, oppressor), another a mur- derer (oppressor, Gypsy), and the third a beggar (deceiver, rascal). The nobleman begins to understand when the farmer explains in detail that his first son is a judge, the second a doctor (butcher) and the third a clergyman (monk, teacher).

The farmer answers, “I did not measure it!” The master says, “No, I wanted to know if it was crowd ed?” The farmer says, “I did not count the people!” Thereupon the master becomes angry and plans to invite the farm er for dinner and then to set his dogs on him. On the way to din- ner the farmer finds two hares. When the master lets his dogs loose the farmer releases his hares so that the dogs chase them [K318]. The master orders his servant to serve the farmer wine in the cellar and then to beat him. When the farmer takes away the plug from the cask, the servant has to hold the hole closed and the farmer beats him. Cf. Type 1539A*. Later the farmer hides a piece of bacon under his shirt and bends over as he climbs the stairs. When people ask him if he has enough, he answers, “Now I have enough for my children and for myself to lick for six weeks!” When the farmer is brought to court for beat- ing the servant, he pretends to be an idiot and therefore cannot be tried.

One noble does not want to pay and agrees, instead of payment, to carry the potter into the palace on his shoulders. Or, the king sets a riddle to his nobles: What is the worst evil in the world? They do not know an answer. Only the potter knows it. He demonstrates the solution by placing himself onto his cart with pots and tells a nobleman (who asked him for the solution) to pull it to the palace. The king appoints the potter nobleman.

|921F*     Plucking Geese (previously Geese from Rus). A farmer (craftsman) impresses a ruler by his clever questions and answers, which his courtiers were not able to give. The ruler promises to send the farm er geese (other birds, animals) for him to pluck (cut, milk, skin). The “geese” are courtiers who, under threat of dismissal (death), have to solve riddles that the farmer poses. (The ruler says, “The geese from Russia are flying here [the nobles]; pluck them!”) Making use of the ruler’s advice, the farmer takes much money from them (for explaining the answer to the riddle).

|922       The Shepherd Substituting for the Clergyman Answers the King’s Questions. (The King and the Abbot) [H561.2]. A person of high social status (emperor, king, civil servant, teacher) demands that a clergyman (bishop, abbot, priest, petitioner) answers three difficult questions within a certain period of time on pain of death [H512, H541.1]. The clergyman cannot answer the questions and therefore sends a  (disguised)  representative  [K1961]  (servant,  shepherd,  miller, brother ). This man answers all the questions correctly for him. When the deception comes to light, the questioner forgives the ruse and re wards the person who answered [Q113.4] (often spares the life of the superior or the brother). Many of the questions require measuring (counting) something  

FFC 284                         Realistic Tales (Novelle)                            553 that cannot be measured (counted). By means of wordplay (How much does the moon weigh? A pound, since it has four quarters [H691.1]), by setting an impossible condition at the end of a non- provable statement (How many leaves are on the tree? So and so many, and if you do not believe, count them [H705.2], or as many as there are stems [H705.1]), or of a non-provable comparison (How many stars are in heaven? As many as grains of sand are on the beach, and if you are able to count them, you know how many stars are in heaven [H702]), etc., the person answering turns the question- ing ad absurdum. The questions include, “How many drops of water are in the sea?” [H696.1]; “How high is heaven?” [H682]; “How many hairs are on my head?” [H703]; “How many seconds are there in eter- nity?” [H701.1]; “How far is one end of the world from the other?” [H681.1]; “Where is the center of the earth?” [H681.3.1]; “How much is the king worth?” [H711.1]; “What is the sweetest song?” [H634]; “Which is the best fowl?”; “What is the swiftest, the sweetest and the most costly?” [H633, H638]; “How much is a golden plow worth?” [H713.1]; “What does God do?” [cf. H797]; “How far is it from for- tune to misfortune?” [H685]; “What am I thinking?” [H524.1]. Cf. Types 875, 920A.

When the minister becomes old, he recommends the king his foster-son as his successor. The young boy is appointed to the office, but slanders his foster-father. The king or ders that the old minister to be killed. Instead, he is saved, and a slave is killed in his place. When a hostile king learns about the minister’s death, he sets the king tasks that cannot be accomplished by anyone. He asks for a person who is able to build a castle in the air and who can answer difficult questions. The king searches desperately for his old minister. When he learns that he is still alive, he just reinstates him in his former posi tion. Under a different name the old minister travels to the hostile king. He lets a child sitting in a basket be carried into the air by an eagle, where the boy exclaims, “Give me stones and lime so that I can start building the palace!” After solving all the riddles set by the king, he returns with a rich reward. He asks his foster-son to be summoned and punishes him with a cruel death.

|922B      The King’s Face on the Coin. A king meets a farmer (smith) and re- ceives enigmatic answers to his questions. When the farmer later explains the sense of his answers the king forbids him to reveal the solutions unless he has seen him (his face) 100 times. Then he gives a (several) coin to the farmer. When the king reports his strange conversation with the farmer to his advisers, none of them knows an answer. They locate the ques- tioner who, as instructed, refuses to tell them anything. But he gives in when his demand the payment with a certain number of coins with the king’s picture on it is fulfilled. When the king hears the solution from his advisers, he suspects that the farmer has told the secret and reproaches (punishes) him. But the farmer is innocent because he had seen the picture of the ruler 100 times on the coins. He is rewarded by the king (appoints him adviser, marries him to his daughter) [J1161.7].

|923        Love Like Salt. A king (rich man) asks his three daughters, how much they love him. The two elder ones compare their love with pre cious (sweet) things (gold, precious stones, sugar, honey, pre cious clothes), but the youngest says that she loves him like salt [H592.1]. The father is offended by his youngest daughter’s answer and casts her out (orders her death), whereas he rewards the elder daughters in proportion to the value of their flatteries [M21]. The youngest daughter then works as a maidservant in a foreign country, whose king she later marries. She invites her father to the wedding meal and serves him dishes without any salt. Thus the fath er becomes aware of the indispensability of salt. The daughter discloses her identity. Cf. Type 510B.

|923B      The Princess Who Was Responsible for Her Own Fortune. When a king asks his (three) daughters who is responsible for their good fortune (who has the blessing of the kingdom, wealth and honor), the elder daughters answer that he is the one, but the youngest says that she herself (only God [cf. Type 841]) is responsible (she states that a woman is responsible for her husband’s fortune). Her father becomes angry at her statement and forces her to marry a beggar (cripple) with whom she must live in humble cir cum stances (she is driven forth). Some variants begin with a description of a prince who became a cripple: A prince observes the struggle of two snakes and helps the weaker one, asking that it not harm him. Nevertheless the snake creeps through his mouth into his body, deforms him, and makes him sick. The prince is cast off by his father and becomes a beggar [L419.2]. Through his wife’s wit (skill) the beggar becomes rich, becomes a king, or is cured of his disease [N145]. In other variants the husband magically returns to his former iden tity as prince [D1866]. The father visits the new king, recognizes his daughter and is forced to admit that she is responsible for her own fortune. Or her father has, in the meantime, lost his kingdom [L419.2], and wanders impoverished to the palace of his daughter.

|924       Discussion in Sign Language. (Including the previous Types 924A and 924B.) [J1804]. Two men (king and shepherd, priest and Jew [H607.1], Roman and Greek, soldier and artist) have a conversation (dispute) in sign language. Interpreting signs falsely they misunder- stand each other; e.g.: The king holds up one finger meaning, “I alone am powerful”. The shepherd thinks the king is asking for one sheep and holds up two fingers, meaning he will give two sheep to the king. The king interprets the two fingers as meaning, “God is as powerful as you”. (Previously Type 924B.)

|926A      The Clever Judge and the Demon in the Pot. In order to possess a beautiful woman, a demon (magician) takes on the appearance of her husband and claims her as his wife. The husband and the demon argue about which is the real husband. Numerous persons are asked for advice, but nobody can distinguish between the two men. Finally a judge (clever boy [who plays at being a king or a judge], shepherd, hare, jackal, parrot) states that whichever can creep into a pot (tube) is the real husband. The husband is not able to enter, but the demon creeps inside immediately. The pot is covered, and the demon is recognized and trapped. The real husband gets his wife back [J1141.1.7]. Cf. Types 155, 331.

|926C      Cases Solved in a Manner Worthy of Solomon. This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with the idea of unusual, of- ten clever, methods to determine the truth [J1141ff.]. Cf. Types 1534, 1833J, and 1833K. Examples: (1) A poor man finds a purse with money in it and returns it to its owner hoping for a reward. The owner pretends that some money is missing, and that the finder took it already for his reward. The judge decides that, since the amount of money is different, the purse did not belong to the man who claimed it, and that the poor man may

(2) A judge gives sticks to all the suspects in a court case and tells them that the guilty one’s stick will grow during the night. The guilty man cuts a bit off his stick and thus is discovered.     (3) Someone announces to all the people in the village that the thief has a gnat on his cap (that his cap is burning). One man reaches for his cap and thus shows himself to be the thief [J1141.1].     (4) All the suspects are required to touch some object in the dark, and are told that the hand of the guilty one will be blackened. In fact, the object blackens any hand that touches it. The guilty man does not touch the object and is thus the only one whose hand is not black ened [J1141.1.4].     (5) In order to determine which of two women is the owner of a spindle of thread, the judge asks them what the spindle is made of. Only the owner knows the right answer [J1179.6].     (6) Disputants are ordered to fabricate a copy of the disputed object (precious stone) [J1154.2]. The owner and the cheater can do  so, but the false claimants cannot.     (7) A man (innkeeper) whose silver has been stolen summons his guests (employees) to the table and orders them to make vari- ous ridi culous gestures. When they are all engaged in this game, he com mands them to put their heads under the table. Then he asks if the thief has head under the table. The thief answers, “Yes”.

|926D       The Judge Appropriates the Object of Dispute. (Including the previ- ous Type 518*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a dispute between two parties that is decided in favor to a third person who is to judge their case. The judge either takes the contested object as evidence or destroys it [J1171, K451, K451.1, K452]. Cf. Type 926C.  For example, two cats fight over a rice cake, and the monkey who is to decide the case eats it. A lawyer who is to decide the case of two men charges them such high fees that he is able to buy the disputed object (calf) with his earnings. The song of a bird was not meant for the plaintif but for the judge. Cf. Types 51***, 400, and 518.

|926E      Eginhard and Emma. After spending the night with the emperor’s daughter in her chamber, her lover cannot leave without being dis- covered because snow has fallen. She carries him on her back to his apartment because her own footprints are less suspect [K1549.3]. The emperor observes this and brings the case before his advis ers. To end the ensuing arguments, he permits the lovers to marry.

|926A*     “Purchase Not Him Who Surpasses You.” (Including the previous Type 654B*.) A father (widow) sends his son (three sons) away to learn a craft (earn money). But the boy learns to play an instrument and cards instead. When he is to be sold as slave to a merchant (when he seeks employment with a rich man) he says, “Do not buy someone who is superior to you”, or “Whoever takes me will regret it; whoever does not take me will regret it twice as much”. By his clever actions, by playing off persons against each other, by his music, and by gambling he succeeds in different situations. At the end he marries the daughter of the rich man (dealer, captain). When his father-in-law violates a king’s decree (ships are no longer  allowed to shoot cannons) and is condemned to death, the youth frees him from the gallows (with three empty nutshells, which signify his father-in-law’s worth). At the end, the young man attains wealth and honor.

|927        Out-Riddling the Judge. A man (woman) condemned to death is set free when the judge cannot solve the riddle propounded to him by the condemned person (by a relative of the condemned) [H542, R154.2.1]. The riddle refers to extraordinary or accidental events that happened to the person setting the riddle, and thus is unsolvable for outsiders. There are four main riddles: (1) Samson riddle of the living in the dead, “From the eater came forth meat and from the strong sweetness” – Swarm of bees col- lects honey in a lion’s carcass [H804]. (“What has seven tongues in one head?” – Bird’s nest with seven young found in a horse’s head [H793]; “Drink this wine which a bird took to its nest” – A stork took a bunch of grapes to nest, and a boy makes wine from them [H806].) (2) Riddle of the nursing daughter, “Formerly I was daughter, now I am mother; I have a son who was the husband of my mother” – Woman has nursed her imprisoned father (woman nurses her son, wife nurses another man) through a crack in the prison wall [H807, R81]. Cf. Type 985*. (3) Ilo-riddle (propounded by a woman), “Love I sit, Love I stand; Love I hold, fast in hand; I see Love, Love sees not me. Riddle me that, or hanged I’ll be” – A woman has killed her dog named Love (Ilo); from its skin shoes, gloves and a chair-covering have been made; (“With what thinks, I drink; what sees, I carry; with what eats I walk” – A woman has killed her lover, from his skull a cup has been made, from one of his eyes a ring and she carries two of his teeth in her boots [H805]). (4) Riddle of the unborn, “I am unborn; I ride the unborn (I eat the unborn)” – A boy was born by Caesarean section; he has a horse that was also born unnaturally (he eats the meat of an animal that was taken out of its dead mother’s body) [H792]. Cf. Type 851.

A rich man (king, merchant, landlord) learns of the prophecy (he dreams) that a poor boy will become his son-in-law (heir). Therefore he tries to kill the boy by various plots (exposure). Finally the boy has to deliver a letter that orders his own death [K978]. The letter is exchanged (modified) by a helper [K511], so that the boy is married to the daughter of his adversary and shares in his rank and wealth [K1355]. Cf. Types 461, 910K, and 1525Z*.

|930A       The Predestined Wife [T22.2]. (Including the previous Types 930B– 930D.) A respected man learns by a predicition that a very young (newborn) girl will be his future wife [M359.2, M312.1.1]. Not willing to marry the ugly child, he tries to kill her [M370] by stabbing her [S115], by piercing her forehead with a needle [S115.2], or by adopt- ing her in order to expose her afterwards [M371, S143]. The girl sur vives [R131], grows up, becomes very beautiful [D1860], and is mar ried to the man. After the wedding he discovers the scar [H51] (needle) and learns from his wife’s life-history that the prediction has been ful filled de- spite his actions [N101]. In various regions different forms of the tale have originated (pre- viously Types 930B–930D): Northern cycle (Danish, Swedish, Estonian, Irish and Icelandic vari ants): A man witnesses the prediction of his future, tries to kill the girl in various ways by exposing her in water, by nailing her by her hands to a tree, or by sending her out with a letter that orders her death. The girls survives, marries the man, and is finally recognized by her scars as the predestined wife. Southern cycle with a wide regional dispersion (Greek, Slovene, English, Scottish, Irish, Estonian, Spanish and Brazilian variants): The marriage of the fated child is combined with the further condi tion: A ring that had been thrown into the water has to be found again. The ring is finally located in a fish’s belly [N211.1]. Cf. Type 736A.

|931       Oedipus. A prophecy (dream) foretells that a certain newborn child will kill his father [M343] and marry his mother [M344]. In order to avoid this fate, the child (Oedipus) is exposed [M371.2]. The boy is rescued and reared by shepherds [R131] (he grows up at a strange king’s court [S354]). There he unwittingly kills his father [N323] (who was employed as a gardener) whom he did not recog nize. Upon the king’s advice he marries the wife of the dead man and learns later that she is his own mother [T412]. 

Remarks: Classical origin: Homer, Odyssey (XI,271–281), Sophocles, Oedipus Rex.  
All of the variants classified under Type 931 contain general prophesies of fate.  
Beside exposure, parricide (cf. Type 931A) and mother-incest, brother- and sister- 
incest, playmate-dispute and fratricide occur in various combinations. It should  
be noted that not Oedipus’ particular deeds but rather the inescapability and the  
fulfillment of the prophecy are the primary criteria for a tale’s classification as  
Type 931.

|931A      Parricide. This miscellaneous Type comprises various tales (with legendary traits) dealing with a person who kills his father (parents). Examples: (1) A father reproaches his son for his dissolute life, and the son kills him. A saint protects the sinner from despair and leads him to repent and do penance for his crime. (2) It is prophesied that a certain child (Judas) will bring great sor- row to humanity. The child is exposed but is adopted and raised by a childless queen. When she gives birth, the adopted child mur ders her child and flees to Jerusalem. When he steals apples in a garden he is caught there by the owner. He kills the owner and marries his widow, who is (although he does not know this) his own mother. (3) It is prophesied that a certain young man (Julianus Hospi tator) will murder his parents. He flees in order to avoid this, and marries. His parents search for him and come to his house, where his wife invites them to rest in their marriage bed. When the son arrives home and sees two people in his bed, he thinks his wife is unfaithful to him and kills both of his parents. When he learns what he has done, he repents and does penance. His sin is forgiven. Or, a young man kills his parents (father only) because a false adviser has lied to him, saying that his wife is an adulteress. (4) After his wife dies, a lord falls in love with his own daughter. She gives birth to a son (Albanus), who is exposed. He is rescued and raised by a childless king. When the boy grows up, he becomes king himself. His natural father hears about this young king and marries his daughter to him. Before the adoptive father dies, he tells the young man what he knows about his origins. The young man’s wife realizes that she has married her own son. After the king dies, the three others go to the bishop and confess their sins. They are required to do penance for seven years. On their way home, they spend the night in a forest, and the father and daughter renew their incestuous relationship. Albanus discovers this and kills them both. He becomes a hermit, is killed, and later becomes a saint. (5) A drunken man spends the last of his money. The devil prom- ises to make him rich if he will murder his own parents, but the man refuses. The devil gives him money anyway, and tells him to restrict his binges of drunkenness to one day each week. The man disobeys, gets drunk every day, and murders his parents [Q211.1, S22].

|933       Gregory on the Stone. The son of an incestuous union [T415] is aban- doned [S312.1]. His mother adds ivory tablets that describe the cir- cumstances of his birth. The boy is saved [R131.14], baptized by the abbot Gregorius who gives him his own name, and grows up in the monastery. At the age of 15, the child Gregorius learns about his mys terious origins and leaves in order to find his real parents. Unwittingly Gregorius reaches his native country where his un- married mother rules. When he saves her from a neighboring ruler’s unwelcome advances, she agrees to marry Gregorius. He has no idea that she is his mother. When she finds the tablets with the history of his origins she discloses her identity. In order to expiate the unwitting incest, she lives a pious life. Gre- gorius undertakes a pilgrimage as penance. At his request a fisher - man fetters his ankles with chains to a rock in the sea [Q541.3] and throws the key into the water [Q544]. Seventeen years later Gregorius is chosen by an angel as succes- sor of the deceased pope. Messengers from Rome look for Gregorius and arrive at the fisherman’s hut. In a fish prepared for the guests, the key for his chains is found (cf. Type 736). Gregorius is elected pope, and when he enters Rome healing miracles take place. His mother makes a pilgrimage to Rome in or der to confess her sins to the pope. They recognize each other [H151. 3]. She enters a convent. After their death both gain spiritual salva tion (Gregorius is worshiped as saint).

|934        Tales of the Predestined Death (previously The Prince and the Storm). (Including  the  previous  Types  934A,  934A1,  934B,  934E,  934A*, 934A**, 934B*–E*, 934E**, 937*, and 937A*.) This miscellaneous type com prises various tales dealing with the prediction of a person’s death. Examples: The time and manner of the future death [M341.1, M341.1.4] of a newborn child (adult) is forecast by norns [M301.12] (nurse, judge, etc.; in dream). The parents of the child overhear the prophecy (they learn it from another person). Different manners of death are predicted: Death by natural forces (storm [M341.2.2], thunderstorm, falling tree), by an animal (wolf [M341.2.6], tiger, snake [M341.2.21], horse), by drowning [M341.2.3], when drinking water, when shearing sheep, by poison ing, on the wedding day [M341.1.1], by hanging [M341.2.21]. The three-fold death of a person caused by e.g. starving, burning and drown ing [F901.1, F901.1.1, M341.2.4] is prophecied. Various pre cautions are taken in order to evade fate [M370] (the person is im mured in a wall, isolated, hidden in a tower [M372]). Neverthe less the prophecy is fulfilled [M341.2, M370.1]. In some variants the predestined fate is averted (by a helper,                                                             1 step mother, eagle, ruse). Cf. Types 506*, 899, 934D .

|934C       Death Forestalls Evil Fates. A mother mourns for her dead children. When she goes to church she realizes that the mass is being per- formed by dead relatives. Then she is shown at the altar what the evil fates of her children would have been (one son is on gallows, the other one is bound to a wheel) if they had not died [N121.2]. She thanks God for having taken her children. Cf. ATU 779F*.

|934D       Outwitting Fate. A man overhears the fate predestined by a god [K1811.0.2] (goddess, soothsayer) decreeing that a boy (prince) will spend his life in poverty but will always own an ox (kill a stag every day) and that his sister will become a prostitute [N121.3]. When the boy grows up, the man advises him to sell his ox every day so that the god must furnish him a new one each day (to wait inside his hut so that the god must bring the stag to him). He advises the girl to demand a handful of pearls for her favors. The god must come in disguise each day because no man can pay such a price. The god soon tires of his duties and agrees to reverse the decrees of fate [K2371.2].

He finds two mice, one black and one white, gnawing at the branch, and sees snakes at the base of the tree. Observing all this, the man forgets his perilous position. When a drop of honey falls from the crown of the tree, he reaches to taste it (reaches for money that lies near him). The branch breaks and the man falls into the jaws of the dragon [J861.1].

|934H      The Origin of Death. This miscellaneous type consists of various tales dealing with the origin of death [A1335] and/or the time of death. Examples: (1) Formerly God let human beings die and return to life, but the moon died forever. A goat (hare) was sent by men to tell God [B291. 2] that they wished to continue to live in this way. But the goat con founded the messages, and the dog [B291.2.1] arrived too late to change it [A1335.1.1]. Since that time, humans die forever. (2) God sends out a chameleon to tell humans that they should live forever (continue to live after death). On the way the chameleon is overtaken by a faster animal that delivers the opposite message [A1335.1]. (3) Formerly Death walked along singing [Z111], but he did not enter the houses of men. An old woman listened to him, liked his song, and repeated it. Thereupon Death followed the woman to her house and bedroom, and when she lay down (to have sexual inter- course) he strangled her. This is how Death first entered the houses of men. (4) In the year before they were to die, people neglected their responsibilities (they repaired their fences with temporary mate rials). Therefore, God decided that they should not know in advance when they will die [A1593]. 

Remarks: Tales dealing with the “falsified message of death” are widespread in  
Africa.

The deception is discovered and the fath er expels his son. Through a trick (cleverness, magic) the young man makes his fortune and becomes king by marrying a princess [L161]. Rich and mighty, he decides to return home. On the way he is held up by robbers (he gambles away all his belongings). His com- panions are all killed, and he himself escapes, but he has to aban- don his royal clothes. When he reaches his parents’ home in humble clothing [K1815], his father accuses him of lying and punishes and humiliates him (by forcing him to tend pigs, goats, sheep, geese). His wife (disguised as hermit, priest, bishop [K1837]) follows him, (overwhelms the robbers) and rescues him from the difficult situ- ation. He then puts on his royal clothes, returns home, and proves his royal identity to his parents.

|936*      The Golden Mountain. (Hasan of Basra.) A man hires himself out to a merchant (landlord) who promises high payment for unspecified labor. The merchant leads him to a high (golden) mountain that can- not be climbed. He (drugs him and) sews him up in an animal skin [K521.1.1]. Big birds carry him to the mountaintop as prey [B31.1]. There he slips out of the skin and throws precious stones (gold) down to the merchant. Later the merchant leaves him, helpless, behind on the mountain. Through lucky circumstances (passage under the earth, plunge into the sea) he escapes. Later he takes service with the same em- ployer. When they arrive at the mountain again, the merchant is tricked into the animal skin and is carried up the mountain. After disclosing his identity to the merchant, the workman makes him throw precious stones down in the same way he had done before. Then he leaves the merchant on the mountain where he dies.

When Eustacius rides again to the place of the vision, the deer reappears. Christ prophesies for him a period of suffering similar to that of Job. He can choose if he wishes to have the suffering now or at the end of his life [J214]. Eustacius decides to have it soon. When his servants and his animals die and all his property is stolen, he escapes with his family to Egypt. A boatman claims his wife as payment for the ferry; when Eustacius crosses a river with his two sons, the boys are carried off by a lion and a wolf [N251]. Farmers and shepherds take the animals’ prey and raise the boys. Eustacius works as farmhand. Many years later Eustacius is found by a legation of the emperor. They persuade him to return. When serving as colonel, he recovers his sons and his wife by chance [N121]. The new emperor in Rome wants them to make sacrifices to idols. When they identify them- selves as Christians, the new emperor Hadrian orders them to be thrown to the lions, but the wild animals do not touch them. Then they are pushed into a red-hot iron bull. Their uninjured bodies are buried by Christians; on the grave a church is built.

|938B      Better in Youth. A married couple has to choose if they prefer to suffer in youth or in old age [J210, J214]. They decide to endure hard ship in youth. The husband sells his wife (voluntarily, by force). The money is carried off by a bird [N527]. As a workman in a foreign land, he dis- covers the lost money in a felled tree in which the bird had built its nest. He is brought before the widowed queen, who recognizes him as her first husband. In some Jewish variants a couple can choose if they want seven good years now or in the future. The woman decides to have it now in order to educate her children. They receive money, most of which they give away as charity. At the end they are told that their good deeds have compensated for the bad years ahead.

|940           The Three Suitors in the Cemetery (previously The Haughty Girl). As proof of his love and his courage, a suitor is told to lie in a shroud in a coffin at the cemetery at night. Another must disguise himself as angel and perform a wake, and a third, disguised as the devil, has to carry away the coffin. When the angel and the devil start to fight, the pretended dead man jumps up. All three flee and thereby lose their chances of the promised sexual intercourse (marriage) [K1218.3].     In some variants an episode follows in which the men take re- venge for the trick.     In Swedish, Finnish, Flemish, German, and Swiss variants the rejected suitors disguise a beggar as prince and send him with coach  and servant to the young woman to woo and marry her.

|944       King for a Year. In a certain city it is the custom that a stranger who is not familiar with its laws is made king. At the end of his reign, all his possessions are taken from him and he is banished to an island. A wise man (who has been warned about this custom) arranges to send everything that he will need to the island (has a city built there), before his banishment [J711.3]. In some variants a dying ruler gives his son a golden ball (apple), telling him to give it to the greatest fool whom he can find. The son de cides to give it to a king who is willing to be banished after reign- ing for a year. Sometimes the gift reminds the king to arrange for money, pos- ses sions, and food to be taken to the place where he will be banish ed. Cf. Type 1531.

|945       Luck and Intelligence. This conglomerate tale type occurs in differ ent forms. The Silent Princess frame with inset dilemma tales is common without the outer Luck and Intelligence frame. The various dilemma tales also occur without any frame. The outer frame is a dispute between Intelligence and Luck, as to which is the more powerful. As a test a shepherd (gardener, farmer) is endowed with intelligence. He participates in a suitor-test for a mute princess, who is offered in marriage to whoever can make her speak [H343]. The clever shepherd tells to the princess that end with a question [F954.2.1, Z16.1] (e.g. a carpenter, a taylor and a clergyman pass the night together. The carpenter carves a girl, the tailor dresses her, and the clergyman animates the figure [F1023, D435.1.1]. To whom does the girl belong? [H621]). Cf. Types 653, 653A. When the princess continues to be silent, he starts to talk to ob- jects or animals who answer wrongly (he himself) in order to tempt the princess to contradict them. Finally she breaks her silence. Cf. Types 559, 571–574. But the king refuses to give the shepherd his daughter and con- demns him to death. He is saved by Luck [N141], which means that Luck is more powerful than Intelligence.

|945A*     Money and Fortune. (Including the previous Types 935**, 946C*, and 946D*.) Money and Fortune (Luck and Blessing) test their power on a poor man. The one who can make him richest will be the winner. Money gives the man money. Soon (three times) he loses all the money (when he is stung by wasps or because he hides it in a pot where his wife finds it and spends it). With Fortune’s help he finds the money again. From then on the man believes in Fortune and be-

Fortune has won the bet because where there is no good fortune, money is worth nothing [N183]. Cf. Type 736. In some variants the frame tale is missing. A poor man (rope- maker, beggar) is given a sum of money three times. Two times he loses the money because of unfortunate circumstances (a bird carries it away; his wife unwittingly sells the pot where it is hidden, he ac cidentally drops it in the river; he forgets the hiding place). The third time he recovers everything because of lucky circumstances, or he finds his fortune in an object which to all appearances seemed worth  less (he receives a fish in whose belly a diamond is hidden) [N183, N421] (cf. Type 736). (Previously Types 935** and 946D*.)

|947A      Bad Luck Cannot be Arrested. (Including the previous Types 842, 947A*–947C*.) A patron (God, rich man) leaves money by the way- side (bridge) where a poor man (hermit) walks. When the poor man reaches that place, he closes his eyes (to feel how a blind man feels when he walks) and so passes by the money without seeing it (he stumbles against the money, thinks it is a stone, and kicks it aside) [N351.2, Q34]. Cf. Types 735, 735A, 745A, and 834. In Chinese variants he fails to see the gold left in his way by God because he is too lazy to sweep away the dust that covers the gold. (Previously Type 842.) In some variants the man is followed by bad luck. (Previously Type 947A*.)

|950       Rhampsinitus. Two thieves (architect and son, two sons of the archi- tect) rob the king’s treasury where a stone in the wall had intention- ally been left loose [K315.1]. The entry-hole is discovered by a ruse [J1143]. The king sets a trap and captures one of the thieves [K730]. At his request, his companion cuts off his head so that his identity can be concealed [K407.1]. The thief’s body is carried through the streets [J1142.4] in order to identify his relatives (and consequently him) by their reactions. The thief’s mother is not able to bear her grief and asks her remain- ing son to bring the corpse home. He manages to steal the corpse by disguising himself and by getting the king’s guards drunk [K332]. To identify the thief, the king allows all men to sleep with his daugh ter but orders her to ask each one about his most impious deed. If one tells her about the theft of the treasure, she is to seize him and hold him fast [K425]. When the thief visits the princess she marks his forehead [H58], whereupon he marks all the other suitors in the same way [K415] (he brings along his dead brother’s arm, which is what the princess seizes). Impressed by the thief’s cleverness, the king announces that he will give his daughter to him. The thief discloses his identity and is honored as the most cunning Egyptian of all. Cf. Type 1525.

|951A     The King and the Robber. (Including the previous Types 951B, 951C, and 951A*). Cf. Types 950, 1525. This tale exists chiefly in four dif- ferent forms: (1) A ruler, roaming about incognito (during the night), meets some robbers [K1812.2]. They boast of their extraordinary abilities and qualities: One can open any door, one understands the lan guage of dogs, and one recognizes any person he has seen once, etc. The king then states that he can save any person from the gallows. To- gether they rob the royal treasury. When the robbers are captured the next day, the king makes his statement come true. (Previously Types 951C and 951A*.) (2) A man (king, bishop, clergyman) is warned that he will die if he does not perform robberies. He does so, and meets a robber (often a man of honor, cf. [3] below) from whom he learns that he himself would be murdered. They both exchange their identifying marks (caps, clothes) and meet again later. The leader of the conspirators is then forced to poison himself. His accomplices are punished and the robber is rewarded. (Previously Type 951B.) (3) A robber (soldier) can open any door with a certain magic ob- ject, but he only steals the profit that merchants have earned unjustly [K1812.2.1]. The king wonders about the robber’s wealth, dis guises himself, and joins him. While robbing the royal treasury the robber prevents the king from stealing (criticizes his greed). The next day the king discloses his identity and rewards the robber for his honesty. (Previously Type 951A.) 

Remarks: Variant (1) was documented in the 13th century by the Persian-speak ing  

FFC 284                         Realistic Tales (Novelle)                            591 

Ǧalāloddin Rumi, Masnavi-ye ma ʿnavi (VI,2816–2921). Variant (2) is traced back to  
the chivalric novel Karel ende Elegast (12./13. Jahrhundert). Variant (3) seems to be  
an independent popular version of an episode from Karel ende Elegast.

|952       The King and the Soldier. A retired soldier (executioner, merchant) meets a hunter (butcher, tailor) on his way (in the forest). Together they pass the night in a house of robbers but their hostess warns them of the danger. At night the robbers return home and take their meal. Enticed by the smell of food, the two companions leave their hiding place and join the robbers. The soldier makes the robbers drunk and paralyses them by magic (a spell) [D2072, K422]. He renders them harmless by his courage and by a ruse or he pours hot wine (oil, water) into their eyes (both guests are discovered by the robbers in their hiding- place; in a fight the courageous soldier kills all the robbers) [N884.1]. The other companion behaves more passively and anxiously. Back in town the stranger discloses his identity as king to the soldier. The sol dier is richly rewarded for his efforts that saved the ruler’s life [K1812.1].

|953       The Robber and His Sons (previously The Old Robber Relates Three Adventures). An old robber has to tell three of his most dangerous adventures to the queen (king) in order to free his three captured sons [R153.3.3, J1185]. The first is the legend of Odysseus and Polyphemus (cf. Type 1137), in which he represents himself as the hero (who overpowers ghost-like cats). The second tells how he saved a child who was to be slaughtered by its mother and cooked and devoured by an ogress. To fool the ogress he had to hang himself on gallows among other corpses and allow the ogress to cut pieces of flesh from his body [K527]. The third adventure is a continuation of the second and tells how

Because of his good deed the queen frees his three sons and rewards him [Q53]. In some variants the rescued child turns out to be the queen’s child.

|954       The Forty Thieves. (Ali Baba.) (Including the previous Type 676.) The tale consists of two parts: (1) A poor man (woodcutter) witnesses robbers entering into a  mountain  by  pronouncing  magic  words  like  “Open,  sesame” [D1552.2]. He then tries the formula [N455.3], enters the mountain, and finds a huge amount of gold [F721.4, N512] which he takes home. (2) His greedy brother, who lends him money scales, discovers his secret when a piece of gold remains in the scale [N478]. The brother goes to the mountain, but he is dismembered by the robbers because he forgets the formula for opening the mountain [N471]. At the request of his sister-in-law, the woodcutter fetches his brother’s corpse, tells a cobbler to mend it and buries it. The robbers plan to take revenge. With the cobbler’s help they find the house of Ali Baba and mark it with a chalk circle, whereupon his maidservant (daughter) marks all other houses in the same way. The robber chief disguises himself as a merchant and asks the wood- cutter for lodging for the night for himself and for his mules laden with jars (casks) of oil. When the maidservant goes to take some oil for her lamp, she realizes that only one jar is filled with oil, and that the robber’s companions are hidden in the others [K312]. She heats the oil, pours it into the jars, and kills the robbers. The robber captain escapes and comes back in disguise (as a suitor ). At dinner he asks for a meal without salt (in order not to be obliged to his host). Thereupon the maidservant becomes suspi cious, recognizes the robber, and kills him. As her reward the woodcutter marries her to his son (nephew).

|955       The Robber Bridegroom [K1916]. A robber (murderer, ogre) disguis ed as a rich man woos the daughter of a miller (princess) who agrees to marry him. The bridegroom asks his bride to pay him a visit in his castle in the forest. She sets out before the arranged time, marking the path with peas [R135] or ashes (the bridegroom has marked the way). When she reaches a house, animals (bird) warn her that it is a house of mur- derers and that she should go back (she gives food to watch dogs in order not to be betrayed). She finds corpses in the house. When she hears the robbers coming, she hides. Her bridegroom (the robbers) brings in a young woman, kills her, and cuts her into pieces. Her finger with a golden ring on it falls into her hiding place. The bride runs away at night and finds her way home safely (with the help of the marks on the path) where she reports to her family what she has seen. When the bridegroom comes to marry her, she recounts her adventure to her guests as a dream. As proof she shows the severed ring (finger) [H57.2.1]. The robbers are arrested and condemned or killed. (The house of the robbers is destroyed, their treasure is distributed, and the girl marries another man.) Cf. Type 311.

|960       The Sun Brings All to Light. A man (Jew, cattle dealer, girl) is held up and beaten by another man (tailor, coachman, innkeeper) and later dies. Just before dying he says, “The clear sun (god, moon, wind) will bring everything to light”. The robber looks in vain for money in his pockets, dumps him behind a thicket, and continues his travels. In the next town the murderer marries and later has a family. One morning as he sits with his wife at the window, he pours coffee into his cup and sees how the sunbeams gleam in it and reflect pat terns on the wall. He repeats the last words of the dying man [D1715]. His wife does not understand the meaning of his words and urges him to give an explanation. He finally tells her confiden tially about the murder. His wife promises not to tell anyone. But she does not keep her promise and three days later the whole town knows what happened. The man is condemned [N271.1].

|960B      Late Revenge. A poor man (farmhand, boy) wants to marry a rich widow (mistress, daughter of a rich merchant). The woman favors him but does not like his poverty. In order to please her and to be able to marry her the young man murders a merchant and seizes his property. He presents himself as a rich man to the woman, who wants to know how he became rich in such a short time. When he (out of love) confesses the truth to her, she asks him to watch at the murdered man’s grave for one night (as a condition for their marriage). He does so. In the middle of the night the dead man rises from his grave, and asks God for justice. Thereupon a (God’s) voice comes from heaven saying, “30 (40, 50) years from today you will be avenged” [M348]. The young man reports his experience. Know ing that the revenge will take place only after 30 years, the woman agrees to marry him. At the appointed time the couple is invited to dinner in a castle and the prophecy is fulfilled. A minstrel who had left the festivity earlier (because he was forewarned), returns to the castle in order to fetch his forgotten glove (book, another object). He sees that the castle (together with all people) has sunk into the earth and only a well remains [Q552.2.1, Q211.0.1]. Cf. Type 780C.

|960C       The Miracle of the Cooked Chicken. Two friends sit at the table to eat, with a chicken on a platter before them. They remark that the chick en cannot get up, not even if St. Peter or Christ commanded it to. The fowl comes to life, flaps its wings, and crows [E524.2.1]. In some variants someone is accused of having stolen a chicken and wants to defend himself from the accusation. The half-cooked chicken announces (in a song) who the real thief was, and the ac cused person is set free.

|960D       Toad on the Head of a Corpse. (Murder with a nail.) Encouraged by his mistress, a lover kills her husband (a smith) by putting a nail into his head as he sleeps [S115.2.1]. The wound is not noticed because it is covered by hair. (People suspect the mourning widow but do not find any proof.) After a long time (20 years) the bones of the dead man must be moved. A toad (frog) is found sitting on his skull, which rolls around. A grave-digger (policeman, sexton) discovers the nail. The wife, who had married in the meantime, is called before a judge (clergyman) and confesses (and is condemned to death).

|961        Conqueror of Robber Discovers His Money-Stick. Thinking that he has killed a robber in a struggle, a man takes the robber’s stick (knife) and continues on his way. Disguised as a beggar he meets the robber who has recovered in the meantime. The robber looks at the man’s stick inquisitively, whereupon the man becomes suspicious, exam- ines his stick, and unexpectedly finds money inside it. In some variants the dead robber’s companion appears instead and tries to get hold of the money hidden in the stick [K437.4].

|961B      Money in the Stick. A refugee entrusts his host with his money. When the refugee asks for the money back, the host denies that he has it. The refugee, hoping for justice, files a lawsuit. The clever host hol- lows out a walking stick and puts the money inside it. He gives the stick to the refugee to hold and, under oath, swears that he has re- turned the money. Enraged by this falsehood, the refugee throws the stick to the ground and it breaks. The money falls out and the trick is exposed. The refugee takes his money back and the cheater hangs himself [J1161.4].

|965*      Robbers’ Alarm Bell. In order to know when travelers pass, a robber (robbers) has stretched a wire to which a bell is fastened across the road in front of his cave [K413]. The robber seizes the travelers, drags them into the cave, robs and kills them. A girl whom he had caught stays in his cave and keeps house for him. After seven years with the robber, the girl asks permission to go to church. She is allowed to go on condition that she will not talk to anyone about the robber or where she is living. After mass, the girl stands before the church door and tells her story in public to the door (wall, oven of the clergyman) [H13.2.4, H13.2.7]. She further explains that she intends to buy peas in order to mark the way to the cave. The clergyman and the village people follow the traces, encircle the cave, seize the robber, free the girl, and destroy the cave.

|968       Miscellaneous Robber and Murder Stories. (Including the previous Types 956C, 956A*–956D*, 963*, 967**, and 970*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with robbers and murderers as characters. In numerous tales robbers are cheated by the clever actions of a girl (other person): e.g. the girl seizes the beard of a robber con cealed under bed [K434.1]; slams the lid of a (money-)chest on a robber when he looks into it [K434.3, S121]; blinds a robber and escapes by throwing magic objects; puts a corpse instead of herself in the rob- ber’s house. Sometimes the robbers escape when a girl enters their house (cf. Type 130) or mocks them. In some variants the robbers cheat a person in order to take their goods [K343.0.1], or someone simulates a robbery in order to get money.

One man on board, an ap- parent evil-doer, seems to be the cause for the distress at sea. He has to be identified and thrown overboard to placate the storm [S264.1]. The sinner is found by casting lots (throwing dice), and when he is thrown into the sea the storm abates. In some (Christian) variants the guilty person confesses his deed voluntarily, whereupon the storm abates (supernatural deliverance of the victim).

|976       Which Was the Noblest Act? (Including the previous Type 976A.) On their wedding night, a man allows his bride to visit her former lover (fiancée), in order to keep a promise she had made previously (to cancel the engagement). On her way she meets a robber. When she tells him her story he leaves her unmolested. When her lover (fian- cée) hears about her bridegroom’s (the robber’s) magnanimity, he takes her back to her bridegroom without touching her [H1552.1]. In some variants the tale occurs in conjunction with a frame tale that deals with the discovery of a thief: Three (four) sons inherit jew el ry (money) from their father (merchants bury their fortune). The money is stolen by one of the brothers (merchants). The robbed own ers call a wise man (judge, king, Solomon), who is to discover the thief. The wise man (his daughter) then starts to tell the story (see above). The thief betrays himself unconsciously when he an swers the question, “Who acted in the noblest way?” He argues that the robber in the story was the most noble one (he answers other ques tions in a revealing manner) [J1177]. (Previously Type 976A.)

|978       The Youth in the Land of the Cheaters. A young man sets out on busi- ness and comes to a land where cheaters flourish. After a while he loses all his goods. A one-eyed man (woman) states that the youth’s father had taken the other eye and demands compensation. The same with a one-legged man, who states that the youth’s father had once taken his other leg and now asks for compensation. A barber agrees to shave the young man for “something” and then demands a huge sum of money (other valuables). Finally the young man is rescued from his difficult situation by someone (his wife, another person) who outwits the cheaters and recovers her husband’s lost property. The rescuer demands that the one-eyed man should give up his remaining eye so that he could match it with the other [J1512.2]. In the same way he demands the remaining leg of the one-legged man, in order to compare it with the other one. The rescuer tricks the barber into accepting “something” for his service [cf. J1521.5.1].

|980       The Ungrateful Son (previously Ungrateful Son Reproved by Naive Actions of Own Son). (Including the previous Types 980A–C.) This miscellanous type comprises various tales dealing with ungrateful children (son, daughter-in-law) of an ageing father. They think about and eventually change their behavior because of the analog ous ac- tions of their own son (daughter). (1) When an aged father is banned from the table and served his meals in a wooden cup by his son and his daughter-in-law, the little grandson starts to build a similar cup for his parents to use when they grow old. Thereupon the couple starts to reflect on their undig- ni fied behavior. Thinking of their own old age, they bring the old father back to the family table [J121.1]. (Previously Type 980B.) (2) A son gives his father half a blanket (carpet, cape, cloth) to keep warm. Thereupon the little grandson keeps the other half of the blanket and explains that he will save it for his parents for when they are old [J121]. (Previously Type 980A.) (3) An aged father is abandoned by his son in the wilderness (abyss) in a cart (sledge, basket). The grandson keeps it in order to use it in the same way for his parents when they have grown old (cf. Type 981). They reflect on their behavior. (Previously Type 980C.)

|980D      Meat Springs as a Toad on the Face of an Ungrateful Son. A couple (son) intends to eat a roasted chicken (meal). When the man’s old father passes by unexpectedly, they hide the chicken in order not to share it with him. The old man takes a drink and then continues on his way. When they replace the chicken on the table in order to have their meal, it has turned into a toad (snake) and jumps onto the son’s face where it stays until his death [D444.2].

|981       Wisdom of Hidden Old Man Saves Kingdom. During a famine (war), the young people have an assembly and decide (the emperor orders) that all old and seemingly useless men should be killed. One man hides his father. When everything goes wrong under the young rulers, the wise old man comes forth and saves the situation with his good advice (he helps perform difficult tasks with his wisdom [J151.1]). Thereupon he is honored and the custom of killing old people is aban doned. In some variants the son, who intends to kill his father, realizes that the same will happen to him when he is old, and lets his father live. Cf. Types 921B and 980.

|981A*     Life by a Silk Thread. A wise king, asked by his brother (Damocles, courtier, court jester) why he always looks sad even in happy situ- ations, answers the question by sending for the questioner and pre- tending to plan his execution. The brother is placed on a chair over a pit filled with red-hot coals, with four lances pointing at him and a sword (stone, millstone) suspended over his head on horse’s hair (thread). The king explains that this situation resembles his own: the pit stands for the fire in hell, the lances for death and the sword signifies the divine judge. This is the reason for his sadness and fear [F451.5. 4.2, F833.2].

|982       The Pretended Inheritance (previously Supposed Chest of Gold In- duces Children to Care for Aged Father). Trusting to his children’s care when he is old, a rich man leaves all his property to them. They soon forget their intentions and neglect their father. Thereupon the old man plans a ruse: He starts counting money conspicuously and points to a chest giving the advice that it contains another considerable inheritance. Thereupon the children change their behavior and look after their father carefully. When the father finally dies they find only sand and stones in the chest. In some variants they find a mace with the advice that it should be used to kill anyone stupid enough to give away his inheritance before his death [P236.2, Q281.1].

She serves him dishes that look different but taste identical (different colored eggs, same drinks in different glasses). In response to his question what this means, she compares the dishes with women: Even if they look different, they are all alike.

|984       Palace from Bird Bones. In accordance with his wife’s wish, a king gives orders to build a palace made of bird bones. One bird comes late, and when it arrives, it says it was thinking about whether men or women were worth more. It decided that women must be worth more because those who obey women are subordinate to them. The king rescinds his order.

|985       Brother Chosen Rather than Husband Or Son. Three men are con- demn ed to death. A woman appeals to the ruler for clemency, ex- plain ing that they are her brother, her husband and her son. When the ruler agrees to release only one of them, she chooses her brother, because she is still young enough to marry again and give birth to another son. Only a brother cannot be replaced. Impressed by her explanation (ruse, logic), the ruler frees all three men (brother and son, the brother alone) [P253.3].

|985*         The Suckled Prisoner. (Caritas Romana.) A man (woman) condemn ed to starvation is closely guarded. Only his daughter has permis sion to visit him daily, but before her visit she is always checked thoroughly so that she cannot bring any food. After a long time the condemned man shows no signs of exhaustion.    One day the guardians observe that the daughter suckles her father through a crack in the prison wall (woman suckles son, wife suckles strange man, daughter suckles mother) [H807, R81]. Im                                  - pressed by the woman’s devotion, the judges release the prisoner. Cf. Type 927.

|987        False Magician Exposed by Clever Girl. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms:   (1) A magician deceives the eyes of spectators making them be- lieve that a rooster can pull (carry) a heavy beam (a rope-dancer can push a cart, juggle a beam).   A girl with a four-leafed shamrock (snake, dead toad, salaman der) understands the trick and states that the rooster can only pull straw [K1963.1]. The magician takes revenge by making the girl be lieve she is going through deep water. She raises her dress as high as possible and all spectators mock her. (A lock magically closes the girl’s mouth so that she cannot speak.)   (2) A juggler pretends to be able to creep through a thick beam (stone). The girl with the shamrock discovers that he only creeps over it or next to it. The water-episode follows, and in some variants the girl is bewitched into being lame or crooked.

|990        The Seemingly Dead Revives. A woman becomes ill during an epi- demic and falls into a deathlike faint. Her husband orders her buried and puts a precious ring (clothes) into her coffin. One of the grave- diggers returns to the cemetery at night, reopens the grave, and tries to rob the dead. Thereupon (when he tries to cut her finger) the woman revives, leaves the grave, and returns home to her husband. He receives her kindly and they continue to live together for a long time in good health [K426].
