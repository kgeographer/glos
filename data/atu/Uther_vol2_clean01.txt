|1000      Contest Not to Become Angry. A farmhand (poor boy, strong man, three sons one after another) agrees to a contest with his master (devil, ogre, priest) that whoever becomes angry first (before the cuckoo calls) must allow strip(s) of skin (flesh) to be cut out of his back (have his nose or ears cut off, be beaten) or must pay a large sum of money. The farmhand (third son) heaps abuse on his master or feigns stupidity until the latter erupts in anger. The master tries to flee but finally must take his punishment [K172, F613.3]. Cf. Types 650A, 1351, and 1920H.

|1004      Hogs in the Mud; Sheep in the Air. (Including the previous Type 1525P.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) Left to guard the pigs (cows, horses), a farmhand sells them but sticks their severed tails in the muddy ground. His master pulls the tails out and thinks that the pigs are sunk in the mud (have escaped underground) [K404.1]. (2) A farmhand sells his master’s sheep and hangs their severed tails (bells) in a tree. He thus makes the master believe that the sheep have been carried away by a strong wind (have escaped into the air, have gone to heaven) [K404.3]. (3) A farmhand (thief) kills one ox and puts its tail in the mouth of another, so that his master (the owner of the ox) thinks one ox has eaten the other [K404.2]. (Previously Type 1525P.)

He tells the farmer that he will forge him a hiss and throws the iron into water, where it sinks hissing [W111.5.9]. In some variants, a farmhand is ordered to whet a knife. He whets the whole blade away [K1418].

|1036      Hogs with Curly Tails. The devil (giant, dragon) and a man (Gypsy) have a contest to see who is able to throw more hogs out of a stable (over a roof, fence). The man throws only one hog, the devil all the others. When they are about to divide the animals, the man pretends he can recognize the hogs he has thrown out by a sign: He had turned around their tails. Thus the man gets all hogs with curly tails, the devil only a sick one with a straight tail [K171.4].

|1037      The Ogre Shears a Pig. An ogre and a boy, who breed sheep and pigs, are going to divide what the animals produce. Of the sheep, the ogre gets the lambs to fatten, the boy gets the wool and the milk. Of the pigs, the boy gets the young ones, and the ogre is allowed to shear the pigs and take their milk [K171.5]. Cf. Type 1030. In a shorter version, an ogre (numskull, devil) tries to shear a pig and comments on this experience, “Much screaming, no wool”. 

Remarks: The short version of this type is also popular as a proverbial phrase.

|1045      Pulling the Lake Together. (Including the previous Types 1046 and 1053A.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A man (workman, shepherd boy) threatens the devil (ogre) by pretending that he will pull together a lake (pull away a forest or mountains) with a rope (chain). The devil is intimidated (because he lives in the lake. He tries to kill the man, or gives him gold or other gifts to stop him) [K1744]. Cf. Type 1650. (2) A man threatens an ogre (devil) by pretending to pull away a warehouse with a rope. The ogre is intimidated by the man’s seem ing power. (They tie a rope around the warehouse; the ogre pulls and is crushed beneath the house.) (Previously Type 1046.) (3) A man (farmhand) makes a long rope so he can lead home the whole herd of cattle. (Previously Type 1053A.)

|1091      Bringing an Unknown Animal (previously Who Can Bring an Un- heard-of Riding-Horse). (Including the previous Types 1092 and 1183*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) The devil (dragon, death, bear) and a man make a deal (con- test) to see who can present (after a certain space of time) a horse un like any other. (The devil puts a mask on a sheep, but the man recog nizes it.) The man brings his wife, naked but covered with tar and feathers (hair combed over her face), on hands and knees with her but tocks as the head. The devil has never seen such a horse and is defeated [K216.2]. Cf. Type 812. (2) Like (1) with the difference, that the man is to present an un known game animal. He brings his wife covered with tar and feath ers and pretends to shoot her [K31.1]. (Previously Types 1092, 1183*).

|1091A     Guessing the Name of the Devil’s Secret Plant. The devil plants to- bac co and asks a man who is unfamiliar with this plant to guess its name. (The devil threatens to kill him if he does not succeed.) The man’s wife, covered with tar and feathers, approaches the plant (ruins part of the field), so that the devil orders the supposed animal to get away from his tobacco. Thus the name of the plant is discov- ered [H522, K216.2.1].

|1116      Attempted Burning. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) An ogre (giant, devil) has been defeated by a man in a contest and wants to burn him while he is sleeping. The man learns about this plan and hides in another place. When the ogre returns to the scene of fire, the man is found sitting in the ashes saying that it was a little hot [K1733]. Cf. Type 1115. (2) The devil wants to burn his helper. He locks him up in the hot bathhouse, but the man knows how to escape (runs away, digs a hole under the floor). (3) The devil and a young man make a contest to see who can stand more heat. When both of them are getting hot, the man pre- tends that he is cold and asks for a pillow. The devil gives up.

|1117      The Ogre’s Pitfall. An ogre (ogress, giant, demon) arranges a trap for a man (tells a man to climb a tree which the ogre has cut). The man tricks the ogre so that he falls into the trap himself (is killed by the falling tree) [K1601]. In some variants, an ogre (animal) is tricked into a basket and then rolled down a mountain, or a demon is told to put a millstone around his neck to help him cross the sea. He drowns.

|1133      Making Strong (previously Making the Ogre Strong by Castration). (Including the previous Type 1134.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man tells an ogre (giant, devil) that an ox (horse) is strong because it is gelded [K1012.1]. To become strong, the ogre orders the man to castrate him, and they agree that the ogre will castrate the man the next day. The man substitutes his wife in man’s clothes [K241]. The ogre thinks that she is already castrated. (Cf. Type 153 with the bear in place of the ogre.) (2) An ogre (demon) wants to become as strong as a man. In or der to toughen (heal) the ogre, the man scalds him (injures him other- wise) [K1012.2]. (Previously Type 1134.)

|1137      The Blinded Ogre. (Polyphemus, Tepegöz.) A man (together with others) who is traveling (in a forest, in the wilderness) accidentally comes to the cave (hut) of an (one-eyed [F512.1.1, F531.1.1.1]) ogre [G100] living alone (with his mother) and tending sheep. The ogre catches the man and threatens to devour him. The man pretends to be a physician [K1010] and promises to heal the ogre’s eye(s) (the ogre falls asleep). The man heats a metal spear, thrusts it into the ogre’s eye [K1011], and escapes from the blinded ogre by covering himself with a sheepskin [K521.1] or by hiding under the belly of a ram that walks out of the cave [K603]. Cf. Types 953, 1135. In some variants, the ogre later tries to recapture the man by using a magic ring (object) which compels the fugitive to keep call- ing out,“Here I am” [D1612.2.1]. The man succeeds in escaping from the ogre once more: He cuts off his finger with the ring and throws it into the sea. The ogre goes after the ring and is drowned.

|1138      Gilding the Beard. A (young) man who calls himself “Such a one” persuades an ogre (devil, priest) to have his beard gilt. He covers the beard with tar and leaves the ogre stuck to the tar-kettle. The ogre wanders around with his kettle and asks everyone, “Have you seen such a one?” [K1013.1]. In some variants, a trickster who calls himself “Such a thing” pretends to heal a woman: He covers her with treacle. When she asks her neighbors, “Have you seen such a thing?” they tell her that they never have. Cf. Types 1135, 1137.

|1147*     Thunder-God (previously The Friendship between a Man [Carpen- ter], Thunder-god, and the Devil). A carpenter joins the devil and the thunder-god Perkunas. Together they build a house and plant tur nips (potatoes). Someone steals their turnips. The devil and Per- kunas cannot watch over the vegetables, but the fearless carpenter is able to unmask the “Laume” (a female demon) as the thief and to capture her by squeezing her fingers. The devil and Perkunas are impressed. Quarreling over the house, the three decide that it should go to the one who is able to stay in it one night without being afraid. The car penter is again fearless: He expels the devil and Perkunas from the house by using the witch-tools of the Laume, an iron wagon and a whip. He keeps house by himself and earns his living by selling the devil’s shit (asa foeticla, a medicine) of which plenty has been left.

|1148B     Thunder’s Instruments (previously The Ogre Steals the Thunder’s Instruments [Pipe, Sack, etc.]). The devil (son of the devil, ogre) steals the thunder-god’s instruments (bagpipes, whistle, hammer, etc.). The thunder-god goes to retrieve the instruments. He catches the thief and releases him in exchange for an invitation to the wedding of the devil’s daughter. Many instruments are stored there in a room, but nobody is able to play the biggest one, the bagpipes. The thunder-god and his son ask for permission to play, and thun der and lightning come out of the instrument. Many wedding guests die on the spot, and others disappear forever. 

Remarks: The motif resembles the theft of the giant’s hammer in Greek mythology and in the elder Edda (Prymsqvi›a). In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, it is  
popular as a folk-song.

|1149      Bluff: Children Desire Tiger’s Flesh (previously Children Desire Ogre’s Flesh). This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A woman (man) sees a tiger (other animal). In order to frighten it, she makes her children cry and then tells them that here is a tiger whose meat they can eat. The tiger, terrified, runs away [K1715.4]. A jackal wants to show the tiger that he had been tricked and insists that they go together back to the woman. The tiger, fearing that the jackal will desert him, insists that he and the jackal be tied together. On seeing the two of them, the woman scolds the jackal for having brought only one tiger instead of two (three, ten) [K1715.2]. The tiger thinks the jackal betrayed it. He flees, dragging the jackal with it. (2) A (weak, old) man (Gypsy) frightens an ogre (dragon, devil, tiger) by cunningly demonstrating his power. The ogre fails in trying to kill the man at night, carries a treasure to his home in order to get rid of him, and flees when supposed flesh of his companions is offer ed to him [K1715]. The ogre returns together with a helper and again is frightened away. In some variants, a weak animal makes a strong one believe that it (its children) eats the flesh of the strong one’s companions. Cf. Types 125, 126.

|1157         The Ogre and the Gun (previously The Gun as Tobacco Pipe). (In clud- ing the previous Type 1158.) This tale exists chiefly in two differ ent forms: (1) An ogre (devil) has never seen a gun. A hunter tells him that it is a tobacco pipe. The ogre puts the end of the gun in his mouth, and the hunter pulls the trigger. The ogre spits, supprised that the tobacco is so strong [K1057]. (2) An ogre wants to look through a gun barrel in the smithy. The smith shoots [J2131.4.1]. (Previously Type 1158.) Cf. Type 1228.

|1159         The Ogre Caught in the Cleft (previously The Ogre Wants to Learn to Play). (Including the previous Type 1160.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) An ogre (giant, devil, dragon) wants to learn to play a flute (violin, bagpipes). A man (boy, shepherd) tells him that his fingers are too crooked (claws too long) and they first have to be straighten ed (cut). The man squeezes the ogre’s fingers in a cleft of a tree (vice) and beats him [K1111.0.1]. The ogre frees himself and threatens re- venge on the man. The next time they meet, the man shows the ogre the naked ge- nitals of his wife. When he sees the crevice, the ogre flees [K1755]. Cf. Types 38, 151, and 1095. (2) A man wants to expel an ogre (devil) from a haunted castle. He catches his beard (fingers) in a cleft (vice) [K1111.1]. Sometimes ends like version (1). (Previously Type 1160.) Cf. Types 326, 1162.

|1161      The Bear Trainer and His Bear. (Including the previous Type 957.) A bear trainer with his (polar) bear comes to a mill (farmhouse) and requests quarters for the night. The miller (farmer) gives him a room and tells him that the house is haunted by an ogre (giant, devil, demon, ghost, goblin, troll). During the night, the ogre appears and starts to attack the guests, but the bear hurts and expels him. Since this night, the building has not been haunted. After a long absence, the ogre comes back and asks the farmer whether he still has the big (white) cat. The man answers that the cat in the meantime has given birth to four (seven) kittens. The ogre vows never to come again [K1728].

|1161A     The Fattened Cow. The devil gives a poor man a cow to be pastured for an indefinite length of time. The man sells the milk and grad u ally gets wealthy. After waiting in vain for the devil to claim his cow, the man sells it. When at last the devil does come for his cow, the man shows him his wealth and gives him strange gifts: his father’s comb for comb- ing whiskers (which is a harrow), a whip (flail), a sugar-basin (large wooden mortar), a tobacco-box (trap). Instead of the cow, the man shows him a bear. The devil rides the bear and thanks the man for having fattened the cow.

|1164      The Devil and the Evil Woman (previously The Evil Woman Thrown into the Pit). (Including the previous Types 1164A, 1164B, 1164D, and 1862B.) Three main introductions can be distinguished: (1) A man throws his quarrelsome wife into a pit (well, gorge). Later he feels sorry (compassionate) and he wants to get her out. But instead of her, he pulls up a devil (demon) who lives in the pit and cannot endure the evil woman either. (2) A devil marries (wants to marry) a young woman and is tricked  by his mother-in-law into a bottle (box). A hunter sets him free. (Previously Type 1164A.) (3) (Belfagor.) Souls in hell complain about bad women on earth. The devil(s) wants to test what it is like to live with a wife. In some variants, a man prefers to endure the torments of hell rather than live with his evil wife [T251.1.2.1]. The devil comes to an agreement with him: If the devil cannot live with the man’s wife for a certain time, the man may leave hell [T251.1.2.2]. The devil marries (lives with) an evil woman (widow) whom he wants to get rid of quickly. He gets help from a man (farmer, farmhand). (Previously Type 1164B.) The tale is usually continued by an agreement between the grate- ful devil and the man who helped him: A (rich) person (princess) is possessed by the devil. Twice the devil allows the helper to expel him from the possessed person, and the helper is given a big reward [K1955.6]. The third time, the devil refuses to leave the possessed per son. The helper threatens the devil with the evil woman (his wife, mother-in-law). The devil flees [K2325]. (Previously Types 1164D, 1862B.) Cf. Type 332. 

Combinations: This type is often combined with one or more other types, esp.  
332, 1365B. 
Remarks: Documented in the Indian Pañcatantra (Śukasaptati). Popularized by  
Machiavelli’s satirical adaptation Belfagor arcidiavolo. Chiefly found in northern,  
eastern and southern Europe.

|1165      The Troll and the Baptism. A farmer is on friendly terms with a troll whom he does not want to come to his child’s baptism because he knows the troll’s appetite. Not wishing to offend him, he invites the troll, but says that among the guests there will be the Virgin Mary, Thor the Thunderer, etc. The troll thinks he had better stay away, but he will give the finest present [K1736]. In a Latvian version, the devil promises the youth the maiden he desires, but he must let the devil spend the first night with her. The devil comes to the wedding, but when he hears that Thunder and Lightning have also been invited, he runs away.

|1182A     The Copper Coin. The devil comes to an agreement with a man: He will give the man a copper coin, and whenever it is spent, a similar coin will appear in his pocket again. In return, the man will come into the devil’s power when he is sixty years old. The man buys an expensive property and pays with copper coins, so that all the devils in hell are employed in coining them. When the man threatens to buy another property, the devil terminates the agreement [K183]. Cf. Type 745.

|1184      The Last Leaf. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) The devil creates goats which do so much damage that God finally orders the wolves to kill them. The devil asks for compen sa- tion, and God promises to give it when all the oaks have no leaves. When the leaves have fallen, the devil again claims his compensa tion, but God tells him that there is a big oak in Constantinople which still has its leaves. The devil searches for this tree for months. When he comes back, he sees that all the oaks are in leaf again. Boil ing with rage, the devil puts out the goats’ eyes and replaces them with his own eyes. (2) God and the devil argue about the division of power. God wants to rule during the time when the trees are in leaf, the devil at other times. A wren who witnesses this contract makes some of the trees to keep their withered leaves until spring comes, and the devil gives up. (3) The devil helps a man to perform a task (by giving him money ). In return, the man is to come into the devil’s power when the last leaf falls from the (oak) tree. It never falls [K222]. (The devil angrily slashes the leaves.) Cf. Type 1188.

|1186       The Devil and the Lawyer (previously With his Whole Heart). The devil and a lawyer (judge, bailiff, inspector, etc.) go for a walk. Three (two) times, they meet various persons: e.g. a butcher who wishes the devil will take a pig away, then a farmer who wishes the same for his horse (ox), then a woman who wishes her child be sent to hell. Each time, the lawyer urges the devil to seize the opportunity, but he refuses because the wish was not in earnest. Finally they meet a poor widow (farmer, farmhand) who curses the lawyer for fraud with such intensity that the devil carries him off to hell [M215].

|1188       Come Tomorrow. An old woman (man, smith, farmer) bargains with the devil (death, creditor who claims his money). Finally she per- suades him to come tomorrow, and, in order to be sure, the devil writes the word “tomorrow” on her door. Each time the devil comes for her, the woman shows him the inscription, and the devil goes away. After some days, the devil erases the inscription and threatens to get the woman the next day. The frightened woman hides first in a barrel full of honey and then in a feather-bed. When the devil comes, he is frightened by the strange creature covered with feathers, and flees. Cf. Type 1091. In a Russian version, the devil sets out one day and is tricked by the inscription “come yesterday”. In some variants, the devil comes every day until the gate with the inscription rots. He then claims the soul [K231.12.1].

|1191      Sacrifice on the Bridge (previously The Dog on the Bridge). A master builder is not able to finish a bridge or church (within a fixed time) and asks the devil (ogre) for help. The devil demands in return the first being that crosses the bridge (comes into the church). The mas- ter builder drives an animal (e.g. dog, wolf, cat, rooster, pig, goat) across the bridge (into the church), so the devil is cheated out of his human soul [S241.1]. Because its central element corresponds to Type 1191, the follow- ing version is included here: A king vows to sacrifice the first thing he meets, which turns out to be a miller driving a donkey. When the miller is about to be killed, he pleads that the donkey was in front of him. The donkey is beheaded [J1169.4].

This tale exists chiefly in two dif- ferent forms: (1) Death (angel of death, devil) goes to take a man who begs for a delay long enough to offer a last prayer. The man does not finish the prayer, so death cannot take him. After a while, death causes the man to finish his prayer (having grown very old, the man decides to finish the prayer and die) [K551.1]. Cf. Types 122A, 227, 332, 955, 1187, 1187*. (2) Death (devil) cannot take a man (woman) as long as he (she) sings a hymn (previously Type 1193*) or a song that never ends (pre- viously Type 1199B) [K555.2, K555.2.2]. Cf. Type 1082A.

|1199A     Preparation of Bread. A woman (women, man) can save herself from the devil (demon, dead persons, bear) by describing in detail how bread (flax) is prepared (what it suffers during preparation). When finally a rooster crows (the sun rises), the devil has to dis appear (is transformed into a trunk or stone) [G303.17.1.1]. In some variants, the bread (flax) itself tells about its sufferings and urges the devil to endure the same. The devil flees [K555.1.1, K555.1.2].

|1213      The Pent Cuckoo. Fools build an enclosure of hedges to hold a cuckoo. It flies over one of the hedges. They say that they have not built the walls high enough [J1904.2]. In some variants, a numskull decides to close the town gate so that a bird (e.g. falcon, dove) that flew away cannot escape.

|1215      The Miller, His Son, and the Donkey. (Asinus vulgi.) A miller and his son travel with one donkey (horse). First the son rides and is rebuked  by a passer-by for letting his father walk. Then the father rides and is criticized because he makes his son walk. When both ride or both walk, they are still blamed [J1041.2]. As a lesson, the father shows the son that it is difficult (impossible) to please every one [J1041]. In some variants, at the end the father and son carry the donkey (horse) between them and throw it into the water, or kill it. 

Remarks: Exemplum with a rich literary tradition; documented in the early 13th

|1218       Numskull Sits on Eggs to Finish the Hatching. (Including the previ- ous Type 1677.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A stupid son (a foolish husband) stays alone at home. Among other things, he is responsible for a brooding hen (goose), but bun gles the task: The bird is disturbed and runs away (the numskull kills it). Because he is afraid of his mother (wife), he sits on the eggs himself to finish the hatching (sometimes covers himself with honey or tar and feathers before sitting on the eggs) [J1902.1]. Cf. Types 1319, 1408, 1681B, 1685. (2) A rogue undertakes the strenuous job of hatching eggs for which he is to be well paid. When the employer (e.g. lady of the manor) asks for the results, he burns down the barn with the osten- sibly hatched chickens and pretends that they all have died. (3) A rogue induces someone to sit on eggs in order to put him in a humiliating position [K1253]. (Previously Type 1677.)

|1225      The Man Without a Head (previously The Man Without a Head in the Bear’s Den). A rogue’s (numskull’s) head is cut off by accident (bitten off by a bear, wolf, or crocodile while hunting, torn off in a mill, smashed off by a rock, caught in tree branches). His compan- ions find the corpse without a head and debate: Did he ever have a head? [J2381]. They remember only his beard. His wife knows that she once knitted a cap for him (that the barber often came to shave him), and he therefore must have had a head. 

Combinations: 1241, 1287. 
Remarks: This anecdote seems to have been carried from the Orient to Europe in  
the late Middle Ages. Since the middle of the 16th century, it has often appeared  
in literary sources.

|1225A     How Did the Cow Get on the Pole? This tale exists chiefly in two dif fer ent forms: (1) A student (often the son of a farmer) comes home from the university for a visit. Lying in bed, he wonders how cow-dung could get on the roof. His father informs him that the beam was already dirty when it was installed. Cf. Type 1832B*. (2) (On advice of a rascal) a fool (fools) hide(s) a purse on top of a pole (in a nest on a high tree).The rascal substitutes dry cow-dung for the money. The fool is interested only in how the cow could have climbed the pole [J2382]. 

Remarks: Early forms of version (1) first appear in the middle of the 14th century,  
version (2) is documented in Turkish manuscripts earlier than the 19th century.

|1227      Catching the Squirrel (previously One Woman to Catch the Squirrel; Other to Get the Cooking Pot). Two numskulls (men or women) plan to catch a squirrel. One pursues it while the other runs back home to get a pan (a pot).The first falls from a tree (and is killed). The face of the first is covered with blood from the fall and the second thinks that his companion has eaten the raw squirrel and choked on it. Full of anger, he breaks the pot (on his head) [J2661.3].

|1246       Axes Thrown Away. A fool lets his axe fall. The other people think that this was intentional and throw theirs into the same place [J2171. 4]. Cf. Types 1694, 1825D*, 1832M*. This short episode is usually followed by a second one, in which the fools try to cut down trees in different ways: (1) By burning them down: In order to get fire, one fool beats another’s head so that the latter will see sparks. Cf. Type 1344. (2) By pulling them out: One fool sticks his head in the branches, the others pull and tear his head off. Cf. Type 1241.

|1250      The Human Chain (previously Bringing Water from the Well). (In- cluding the previous Type 1250B.) Fools want to measure the depth of a well (retrieve something from the water). They lay a log across its top. One man holds the log with his hands, the next climbs down and holds his feet, and so on. The uppermost man becomes tired and lets go to spit in his hands [J2133.5]. All fall into the well. In some variants, the human chain is built in order to reach the top of a tree. Cf. Types 121, 1241. In an Indian/Sri Lankan version, the human chain (a chain of monkeys) dangles from the tail of a flying elephant. (Previously Type 1250B.) Cf. Type 225A.

|1260      Porridge in the Ice Hole. (Including the previous Type 1260A*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) Numskulls put flour (rolled oats) into the bubbling current of an ice hole and then, one after another, jump in to taste the porridge [J1938]. They die. (2) Numskulls buy a kettle that is supposed to boil by itself. It does not work so and they throw it into the water. As the kettle sinks down it sends up bubbles. Thinking that the kettle is finally boiling, the numskulls jump into the water to retrieve it. Cf. Type 1535. (3) A woman puts flour in a river (sugar in a well) in order to make dough for bread (lemonade). She loses it all (and her husband throws her out). (Previously Type 1260A*.)

|1260A     Hare Soup. Numskulls throw a hare (crab, locust, sparrow) into boil- ing water in order to make soup. The animal escapes. Later the num- skulls drink the water and maintain that they have good soup. In some variants the “soup” is made from (1) the shadow of an animal (rooster, chicken) that falls on a kettle of water, (2) a hare that runs through a puddle (gets drowned in a river) or by ducks that swim on a pond, (3) water from washing hands (washing out bas kets) that were in contact with meat or fish.

|1262      The Effectiveness of Fire (previously Roasting the Meat). The elabor- ate form of this type consists of several events: A rich man (ruler) promises a reward to anyone who can survive a cold night on the roof of the palace naked. A poor (foreign) man agrees to this proposal and survives the frosty night. In the morning the ruler refuses to give the poor man the reward, claiming that he had used a distant fire (the moonlight) to warm himself. On the advice of a wise man, the poor man invites the ruler to a meal. He puts the pot so far away from the fire that the food cannot cook. When his guests demand an explanation, he explains that the pot will be heated as he himself was warmed by the distant fire. The ruler pays the reward [J1191.7]. Cf. Type 1804B. This tale also exists in a short form: A numskull pretends to roast (believes he is roasting) meat: The fire burns on one shore of a lake, the meat is on the other [J1945]. Cf. Type 65*. 

Remarks: The elaborate version originates from the Arabic-African area and was  
documented in the late 18th century. The short version is mainly found in Europe.

|1284A     White Man Made to Believe He is Black [K2013.1]. A white man who wants to stay in an inn overnight has to share his bed with a black man. While the white guest is sleeping, the host blackens his face. When the white man gets up in the morning and sees his dark face in a mirror, he thinks that the host has awakened the black man instead of him. 

Remarks: This anecdote, although structurally comparable to Type 1284, is treated   
as a different type because of its formation during the 19th/20th century. It is  
found in western Europe and North America.

|1287      Numskulls Unable to Count Their Own Number. Numskulls go swim- ming and then want to find out if everyone is back. The fools cannot get the right result because whoever counts forgets to count himself. They conclude that one of them is drowned [J2031]. A stranger who finds the numskulls in distress tells them to stick their noses in the sand (loam) and to count the holes [J2031.1]. So they confirm that everyone is still alive.

It’s lucky they are still in the letter.” In some variants a servant (girl) is sent to bring a basket of fruit along with a letter. On the way, he eats one of the fruits. The letter states how much fruit there was, so the recipient asks the servant what happened to one of the pieces. He replies that it was not in the basket. He is sent again on the same errand the following day. He hides the letter before he eats the fruit, because he thinks it can observe him.

|1305       The  Miser  and  His  Gold  [W153].  (Including  the  previous  Types 1305A–1305C.) This tale exists chiefly in five different forms: (1) Instead of asking for his wages from a miser, a workman asks to be allowed to see the miser’s treasure. When asked why, he ex- plains that this would give him the same satisfaction as it gives the miser. The latter repents and distributes his wealth among the poor. (Previously Type 1305A.) (2) A miser, whose treasure has been stolen, is advised to imagine that it is still intact; he will thus get as much pleasure from it as be- fore [J1061.4]. (Previously Type 1305B.) (3) A miser, wishing to take his gold to the grave with him, orders it to be melted so that he can drink it. Molten butter is substituted, and the miser is duped. (Previously Type 1305C.) Cf. Type 760A*. (4) Even in grave danger or on his deathbed, the miser thinks about how to make or save money. (5) A miser is robbed while lying on his sick-bed, or his hoard is found after his death.

|1306      Miser Refuses to Give His Hand. A miser (clergyman, drunken man) falls into a well. Men hurry to rescue him (with a rope) and tell him to reach out his hand. He refuses. A wise man advises them not to ask for the hand of the miser but to propose him that he take their hands. The man seizes their hands and is rescued [W153.5].

|1310       Drowning the Crayfish as Punishment. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A small water animal (e.g. turtle, crayfish, toad) has made an enemy of a big land animal (e.g. monkey, fox, lion, elephant) or of a man. The small animal, condemned to death, begs not to be drowned . Thereupon it is thrown into the water and escapes [K581.1]. (2) Numskulls find a crayfish. Because of its claws, the fools mis- take the unknown animal for a tailor and put it on a piece of cloth which it is to cut up [J1762.1.2]. The crayfish ruins the cloth. He is condemned to be drowned and is thrown into the water. When the animal swims with difficulty, one of the fools says, “See how it suf- fers”. (3) Numskulls set out pickled herrings in their pond and hope the fishes will propagate. When the fools drain the pond, they find a big eel which they suspect has devoured the herrings. As a punish ment the eel is to be drowned. Continuated like in version (2). Cf. Type 1208*. 
Combinations: 1260A, 1310*, and 1326. 
Remarks: Version (1) is documented in the 5th century in China in the Po-Yu-King

|1313A     The Man Takes Seriously the Prediction of Death. (Including the previous Types 1313B and 1313C.) A passer-by tells a numskull who is sawing the tree limb on which he is sitting that he will fall. Cf. Type 1240. When the fool falls, he believes the passer-by to be a prophet and demands that he might tell him when he will die. The “prophet” tells him that he will die (1) when his donkey (horse) breaks wind three times [J2311.1], (2)  when  his  hands  and  feet  become  cold  (previously  Type 1313B), (3)  when  a  red  thread  or  the  like  comes  from  his  body [J2311.1.4], (4) other signs. The prophesied event occurs and the fool thinks he is dead. When his pallbearers or passers-by argue over which road to take, the fool sits up and advises them, “When I was alive, I took that one”. [J2311.4]. (Previously Type 1313C.) 

Remarks: Documented in the 16th century. The motif of the dead man speaking  
[J2311.4] is also found in modern legends.

|1331       The Covetous and the Envious. God (angel, saint, ruler) tries to re- con cile a covetous man and an envious one (two hostile neighbors): Whatever one of them wishes, the other shall receive double.

|1331*     Illiterates (previously Learning to Read). (Including the previous Types 1331B* and 1331C*.) This type comprises various anecdotes about people who are not (hardly) able to read (write) [J1746]. Cf. Type 1832R*. Within this miscellaneous type, two versions can be distinguished: (1) A boy cannot read a book because the letters are smaller than in his schoolbook [J2258]. (Previously Type 1331B*.) (2) A fool writes a letter very slowly because the recipient cannot read fast [J2242.2]. (Previously Type 1331C*.)

|1332      Which is the Greatest Fool? Cf. Type 1384. A passer-by salaams to or tosses a coin to two (three, four) men. They ask him for whom it was intended. He says he meant it for the greatest fool [J1712]. Each tells a tale of his own foolishness to prove he is the greatest: (a) Who will speak first. Cf. Type 1351. (b) The hungry fool at his in-laws – cheeks cut. The fool goes to visit his parents-in-law and, being bashful, refuses to eat. Later he stuffs eggs, etc., into his mouth only to be discovered by his mother- in-law who calls a surgeon. The surgeon believes the fool’s cheeks are abcessed and cuts them open [X372.4.1, cf. J1842.2, J2317]. (c) The fool at his in-laws – falls into well. The bashful fool dresses as a beggar to visit his parents-in-law. When his mother-in-law comes out of the house to give him food, he backs away and tumbles into a well, etc. (d) The hungry fool at his in-laws – the priest beaten. Cf. Type 1685. (e) Other tales about fools. The passer-by (king, judge) chooses the winner (all are judged as equally foolish).

|1334      The Local Moon. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A traveling man (woman) is surprised to see that the moon elsewhere is the same as at home (watches a half-moon and is proud of their full moon at home; he thinks he sees his own moon so he must be near his home) [cf. J2271.1]. (2) A traveler in a strange place (a resident leaving his home, not knowing whether it is day or night) asks a passenger whether the star in the sky is the sun or the moon. The passenger answers, “I don’t know. I’m a stranger in this town.”

|1335      The Swallowed Moon (previously The Eaten Moon). A fool watches his cow (donkey, mare) drinking from a pool where the moon is reflected in the water. When the moon hides behind a cloud, the fool thinks that the cow has swallowed the moon. He tells his wife (other fools) what has happened and they decide to slaughter the cow in order to recover the moon [J1791.1]. However, they cannot find the moon in the cow’s belly and regret having killed their poor cow in vain.

|1335A     Catching the Moon (previously Rescuing the Moon). This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A numskull sees the moon reflected in a pond (well) and sup- poses it has fallen in. He calls his companions in order to rescue the moon. One of them throws a rope (net) into the pond, pulls, but falls in himself (together they try to rake out the moon). Lying on his back, the numskull sees the moon in the sky and thinks they have saved it [J1791.2]. (2) Numskulls want to catch the moon in order to have light all the time (to bring light into a gloomy building), or they think that people in the next village have stolen the moon and want to bring it back. They climb a hill (ladder) and try to capture the moon in a sack (see the moon’s reflection and try to keep it by fixing a clamp across the well or pail). Cf. Type 1336.

|1336A     Not Recognizing Own Reflection (previously Man does not Recog- nize his own Reflection in the Water [Mirror]) [J1791.7]. Cf. Types 92, 1168A. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A villager goes to town and sees a mirror for the first time. When he looks at his reflection in the mirror, he thinks he sees his dead father’s face in it. He buys the mirror, hides it at home and often looks into it to greet his “father”. His wife finds the mirror, takes it up, and sees her reflection. She thinks there is another young woman in it, feels jealous and starts quarreling with her husband. A nun who passes by takes up the mirror and says that the woman in the mirror has become a nun (their old mother sees her reflection in the mirror and tells them that there is only an old woman). (More people look into the mirror and are astonished. Finally the mirror is broken. Or, the real nature of the mirror is discovered.) (2) A foolish son sees his own reflection in the water of the well and mistakes it for a thief. He calls his mother to have a look. She agrees with her son’s judgment and adds, “And the thief is accom- panied by such an ugly old woman”.

|1337C     The Long Night. (Including the previous Type 1684A*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Two (male or female) farmers (merchants, master and farm- hand) stay overnight at an inn (in a train compartment). When one of them wants to open the window in the morning, he instead opens the door of a cupboard (opens the window but does not realize that the window shutters are still closed). He says that it is still dark out- side (and the weather is smelling of cheese) and goes on sleeping throughout the day (three days). Cf. Type 1293C*. In some variants, the travelers sleep in an alcove and cannot find the door. (2) A stupid man (several men) is locked in a dark room for sev eral days. He is made to believe that it is continuous night [J2332]. Various reasons are given for this trick: A man wants to get rid of his brother who has been visiting him for too long, or whose unfashion able clothing embarasses him. A father wants to prevent his two sons from going to a party and spending money unneces sarily. People in the city want to stop farmers from going to market to sell their animals. Servants at a hotel want to make fun of one of their guests. Often the victim is a villager who gets the idea that nights in a town must be longer than those in the country. (Previ ously Type 1684A*.) 

Remarks: Version (1) is documented in the early 16th century with references to  
medieval sources. Mainly found in Europe.

|1341A     The Fool and the Robbers. (Including the previous Type 1341B*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) Robbers stumble over a fool lying on the ground and wonder, “What is this, a log?” The fool answers, “Does a log have five annas in its pocket?” When the robbers have taken away his money, the fool says, “Ask the merchant in the tree if my money is good”. Thus the thieves rob the merchant, too [J2356]. Cf. Type 1577*. (2) Three numskulls hide when they see thieves coming. The thieves  find one of them, kill him, and wonder why his blood is so dark (red). On hearing this remark, the second numskull explains from his hiding place that it is because he has eaten blackberries (prickly pears). When the second numskull is killed, the thieves re- mark, “If this one had not spoken we would not have found him”. The third explains aloud, “That’s why I didn’t say anything”. The thieves kill him, too [J581, J2136]. (3) Two foolish slaves are recaptured because of their talkative- ness [J581, J2136]. (Previously Type 1341B*.)

|1341D      The Thief and the Moonlight. A thief climbs to the roof of a house, hoping  to steal something. The owner hears him and speaks to his wife loudly enough that the thief can hear, telling her the following story: Once he himself had tried to steal something by climbing through a window in a roof. He said a spell (prayer) so that the in- habitants would stay asleep. Then he let himself into the house by sliding down a ray of moonlight and stole what he wanted. The thief on the roof copies this and says the spell. The man and his wife snore loudly, pretending to be asleep. When the thief tries to slide down the ray of moonlight into the house, he falls and breaks his leg. He is beaten (hanged) [K1054].

1341A*   Thief as Dog. (Including the previous Type 1363*.) A thief enters a house to steal but stumbles over an object. The husband wonders what the noise is. The wife says that it is probably the dog. Thus the thief crouches like a dog and says, “It is me, the dog”. Cf. Type 1419F. In some variants, two boys spend the night in a girl’s house be- cause of bad weather. The father hears one boy in bed with the girl and asks, “Who is there?” The boy meows like a cat and the father is satisfied. The second boy has the same experience. When the father asks again, “Who is there?” the boy answers, “It is me, the second cat”. (Previously Type 1363*.)

|1342      Warming Hands and Cooling Soup with Same Breath. During a cold winter, a satyr (wood spirit) meets a man (boy) who is cold and accommodates him in his cave. The satyr watches the man blowing in his hand and is told that in this way he wants to warm his numb fingers. When the satyr serves up a meal, his guest blows on the food and explains that he wants to cool it. The satyr is afraid of this strange human behavior, blowing hot and cold in the same manner, and chases the man away.

|1343      Hanging Game. (Including the previous Type 1066.) (Two) fools (children) want to try out how it feels to be hanged. They agree that one of them (shall tie a blade of straw or thread around his neck and) shall be pulled up, while his comrades shall take care to get him down in time (when the hanging man whistles). During the trial, a wolf (devil in the form of a hare) passes by, the fools run after it, and forget to watch their hanging comrade. He dies. (The hanging man tries to whistle, but no sound can be heard. The others tell him that it might not be enough just to purse his lips.) [N334.2].

1349D*  What is Intelligence? (Previously What Is the Joke?) Two men dig- ging a ditch wonder why their foreman can sit in the shade with a cool drink. One of them asks him for the reason and gets the answer, “Because I got intelligence”. The workman does not know what “in- telligence” means. To explain it, the foreman holds his hand up in front of a tree and tells the workman to hit it. Right before the man hits his hand, he pulls it down, and the workman smashes his hand into the tree. The comment is, “That’s intelligence”. The workman returns, and asked by the other one he explains that the foreman “got intelligence”. His companion does not know the word either. So the first man holds his hand up in front of his face and invites his companion to hit it. He pulls his hand down and takes the blow right in his face. In some variants, a nobleman explains to a stupid farmer what a joke is (Irishman shows his companion a Yankee trick).

1349N*  The Mistaken Prescription (previously Leeches Prescribed by Doctor Eaten by Patient) [J1803.2] This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A physician prescribes leeches to a patient. The patient does not know how to use them. He eats some of the leeches raw and asks his wife to roast the others. (2) A sick fool takes the physician’s written prescription with water and gets well [J2469.2]. (3) A foolish woman reads the instruction “to shake before use” and shakes her ill husband instead of the medicine. (4) A foolish farmer brings a door to a pharmacist. The pharma cist is astonished and tells him that the carpenter lives across the road. The farmer answers that his wife is sick but they did not have a pencil and paper in the house, so the doctor had to write the pre scription with chalk on the door. 

Remarks: Version (4) was popularized by Johann Peter Hebel as Das seltsame

|1351      The Silence Wager. A man and his wife make a wager: Whoever speaks  first must do certain work (close the door, wash the dishes, feed the animals, etc.). Strangers (robbers) enter their house and take or abuse their belongings (believe the couple are dead and share their estate). A man rapes the woman (a woman tries to rape the man). The husband (wife) protests (becomes jealous), cries out [H1194.0.1], and thus loses the wager [J2511].

Every time she wants to go to her lover, the (other) parrot holds her back by telling a long story [K1591] (he tells seven stories in seven days), until her husband returns. Cf. Type 1422.

|1355A      The Lord Above; the Lord Below. While her husband is away, a wife is visited by two of her lovers. When her husband suddenly comes home, one hides on the roof and the second hides under the bed. The wife distracts her husband with foolish phrases and accuses him of having wasted all his money on drink. He defends himself and says, “The Lord above will pay for everything”. The man on the roof says he will pay for half, but the man under the bed (below) must pay for the other half [K1525]. Cf. Type 1355C. In Italian variants the meeting of the adulterous wife and her lover is interrupted by a fool who follows his dog into the house. He embraces the woman and hides from the husband in the hearth. When the husband starts a fire, the fool defends himself, “I had your wife only once, but the man under the bed has her a thousand times”. The husband kills the lover and gives the fool money to keep quiet.

|1355B     “I Can See the Whole World!” (previously Adulteress Tells her Lover, “I Can See the Whole World”). A farmer (herdsman) who has lost an animal (horse, donkey, cow) climbs a tree to look for it (looks for it under a bed). He accidentally witnesses a couple embracing. Af- ter their intercourse (on seeing the woman’s naked body) the lover (man or woman) says metaphorically, “I have seen the whole world!” (some similar expression). The farmer asks the man if he has seen his lost animal [K1271.4]. The couple are frightened and run away so fast that they leave some article behind which the farmer takes. (The adulterer gives the farm- er money to keep quiet. If the couple are married, they beat the farmer.)

|1358A     Hidden Lover Buys Freedom from Discoverer. A priest makes ad- vances to a married woman. She pretends to agree to meet him, but tells her husband. At the rendezvous when the husband knocks on the door, the priest, who is already undressed, hides in a vat that contains tar (sirup). When he looks for a better place to hide, he finds himself in a vat of feathers. The man and his wife see him covered with tar and feathers and exhibit him as the devil (the man puts him in a crate and parades him around) [K1555.2, K1554.1]. Important people (people who come to the market) pay to see this “devil” (cf. Type 1358B). The priest often has to give all his wealth in order to ransom himself [K443.1]. 

Combinations: 1358B, 1358C, 1525, 1535, and 1725.

|1358C     Trickster Discovers Adultery: Food Goes to Husband Instead of Lover [K1571]. A traveler (student, soldier, etc.) asks for food and lodging, so a housewife gives him plain food and tells him to sleep in the haystack. He sees her (through a window) feasting in the company of her lover. When the husband comes home unexpectedly, he tells the trav eler he would invite him in if he could offer him decent food. When the wife pretends that there is no food in the house, the traveler (with the help of a bird or magic implement) pretends to use magic to produce the (hidden) food leftover from the feast. He uses pretended magic a second time to raise the devil (ac tually the hidden lover) and chase him away. The lover and the wife or the host give the traveler a generous reward. Often the husband buys the magic object from him. Cf. Types 1535, 1725.

|1358*     Child Unwittingly Betrays His Mother’s Adultery. While her hus- band is away, a wife makes advances to one of his employees. This man draws a chalk circle on the floor and warns that he will “take revenge” on her if she crosses the line. The eager wife crosses the line and the employee has intercourse with her. When the husband returns, a child, who has seen what hap pened, warns him not to cross the line because if he does, the employee will do to him what he did to the mother, lie beside him and “fight” [J125.2.1].

|1359B     Husband Meets the Lover in the Wife’s Place. A husband suspects that while he is away at mass, his wife is having an affair with their children’s tutor. The husband wants to find out if this is true. One day when his wife is away and the husband is at home with the tutor, he invites the young man to a luxurious feast and offers him plenty of wine in order to loosen his tongue. The young man con- firms the husband’s suspicions, and is pardoned on the condition that he breaks off the relationship. Soon after, however, the merchant notices that the affair is still going on. In order to put an end to it, one morning he orders his wife to go to mass instead of him. As she leaves, she slams the door hard to signal to the young man that it was she and not her husband who went out. The young man wakes up late, believes that the husband has left, and goes to the wife’s bed, where he finds the merchant. The merchant insults him and beats him (castrates him) [K1561].

|1359C     Husband Prepares to Castrate the Crucifix. A sculptor (icon-maker) and his wife want to put an end to the unwelcome attentions that the clergyman has been paying to the wife. She plans a meeting with the priest in the studio (in the church) and persuades him to take off his clothes (and paints his body). Surprised by the sudden appearance of the sculptor (icon-maker), the priest pretends to be Jesus standing before the cross among the sculptures (icons). The husband is about to castrate the figure (cor- rect the sculpture) because the customer (bishop) sup posedly does not like such a realistic representation. The priest runs away naked [K1558]. Cf. Types 1730, 1829.

1359A*  Pulling Out Hairs. A merchant (clergyman, monk, Jew) spends the night in a farmhouse, sharing a bed with the farmer and his wife. When the traveler wants to have intercourse with the wife, he pulls out a hair from the husband’s backside to find out if he is asleep. This happens several times, until finally the husband turns over and says, “I don’t mind what you do with my wife, but please don’t use my backside as a scoreboard!” In some variants the cheated person (teacher) discloses his iden- tity by joining in the chorus when the two others (priest and nun) talk about the pleasure they have had the last night in a recip rocal song.

|1360B     Flight of the Woman and Her Lover from the Stable. When the hus- band is away from home a servant (guest, the husband himself) accidentally (from the roof) observes the housewife (his wife) with her lover (man, priest). When the servant is asked why he did so little work, he recites a verse that describes what he saw (he de scribes the event in the form of a story which he tells at dinner). The wife gives him money to stop telling the story [K1271.1.4.1]. He con cludes by saying that it was only a dream [J1155]. In some Estonian variants the tale continues: Because there are too many guests, the housewife cannot receive her lover. One guest pre- tends to be the housewife and refuses to let the lover come in, but instead castrates the lover through the window.

|1360C     Old Hildebrand. An unfaithful wife pretends to be ill and sends her husband for medicine. On his way the husband meets another man and has him carry him in a basket (sack, bundle of straw) back to his house, where his wife is entertaining her lover (the priest). They invite the man with the basket to eat with them. All three sing verses: first the wife, then the lover, then the guest. Often the husband in the basket sings the final verse. He comes out and a brawl ensues [K1556].

|1361      The Flood. A clergyman (student) who wants to have a private meet- ing with a woman announces that a flood is coming. Her husband (carpenter, merchant, miller, farmer) tries to escape the flood in a tub tied up under the roof [K1522]. While the adulterous couple are enjoying themselves, another lover comes and wants to take part or at least to have a kiss. The wife (clergyman) puts her (his) backside out the window and invites the lover to kiss it [K1225]. He realizes he was tricked and, as if it were a second kiss, brands the backside of the clergyman with a hot iron [K1577]. When the clergyman cries for water, the husband in the tub thinks the flood is coming. He cuts the rope, falls to the ground, and injures himself (dies).

|1363       Tale of the Cradle. Two traveling students spend the night in the house  of a family with a beautiful wife and daughter. Everyone sleeps in the same room, with the youngest child in a cradle at the foot of the marriage bed. During the night one of the students sneaks into the bed of the daughter. When the mother leaves the room, the second student moves the cradle, so that when she comes back she mistakes his bed for hers and him for her husband. When the first student tries to go back to his own bed, he too is con fused by the position of the cradle. He gets into bed with the father  and, thinking that this is his friend, tells him what he has done. The father becomes angry and starts to beat the student. When the mother turns on the light, her lover puts the cradle back and moves his friend into their original bed. When she realizes what has hap- pened, she tells her husband that they were visited by a demon. The students leave the following morning [K1345].

|1364       The Blood-Brother’s Wife. A lover boasts to his good friend that he has had a narrow escape from the husband of his mistress. The lover does not realize that this friend is in fact the husband, and tells him the particulars of his plans for the future (the time of their next appointment, etc.). Unbeknownst to the lover, the husband uses this information to try to surprise the guilty pair. Three times the couple are surprised by the husband, but the lover escapes by hiding behind a curtain, under the bed, in a cupboard, in a  cistern, etc. Later (at a banquet) the lover boasts about his liason and adventures. He is accused of misconduct and asked to confess. He saves himself by saying it was all a dream [J1155]. Cf. Type 1790.

|1365E     The Quarrelsome Couple. (Including the previous Types 1365D*– 1365K*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with married couples who quarrel about some minor problem, such as which of them should have the third of three eggs (previously Type 1365D*), whose is the hair that is in the soup (previously Type 1365E*), or whether the holes in the floor were made by rats or by mink (previously Type 1365G*). Or, the husband always asks the wife for the opposite of what he wants (previously Type 1365J*). Sometimes they argue about the kinds and sizes of birds (previously Type 1365H*) or other triviali- ties, and the wife lets herself be buried alive rather than give in (pre viously Type 1365F*). In some variants the husband is so stubborn that he lets himself be buried rather than give in to his wife.

|1367*     Better to Hang Than to Marry an Evil Woman (previously To Live with Evil Woman). A pilgrim is convicted of a crime and is sen tenced either to pay a fine or to have his eyes put out (be executed). He has no money so he is brought, blindfolded, to the place of exe cution.

|1370      The Lazy Wife is Reformed (previously The Lazy Wife). A young man marries a rich (beautiful) woman. He knows she is lazy, but promises not to beat her (he finds out how lazy she is only after the marriage). Before he leaves he orders the cat (dog, donkey, purse, animal hide) to do the housework. When he returns and finds that the work has not been done, he asks his wife to hold the animal (object) while he beats it for its dis- obedience. The blows fall on the wife as well as on the animal. After this happens once (twice, three times), the wife does the house  work without complaining [W111.3.2]. Cf. Types 901, 901B*.

Her father-in-law (mother) says the bread will succeed only if she sweats from her forehead and backside when she is kneading it (she should continue to knead until the front of the oven [her fore- head] sweats). She follows his advice and touches these parts of her body again and again while she kneads in order to see if she is sweating. (A neighbor advises her to add a handful of dirt, which she does.)  [J2499.1].

|1375      Who Can Rule His Wife? (Including the previous Type 1366A*.) This type exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A man goes on a journey to discover whether husbands or wives have more power. He takes along two (more) horses (symbols of masculinity) and many eggs (nuts, hens, other symbols of femi nin- ity, agricultural products that belong to the female sphere of work). Wherever a husband rules the house, the traveler gives him a horse, and wherever a wife is the master, she receives an egg. There is a great demand for eggs [T252.1]. Finally the traveler finds a man who claims to be master. When this man chooses a horse, his wife contradicts him and he has to settle for an egg. (2) A ham is offered as a price to any man who does not regret his marriage vow during the following year (and a day), or who can prove that he is not afraid of his wife. (3) A piece of bacon is hung at the city gate with a written mes- sage: “It will go to whichever husband will swear that his wife does not dominate him”. The farmer who claims the bacon refuses to hide it under his smock, because he is afraid of what his wife will say if he gets marks from the fat on his Sunday coat. (4) A priest asks all the men who consider themselves to be mas- ters of their house to sing the song “Christ is Risen”. All the men are silent and all the women (only one man) sing. Or the priest sings the song by himself. The next year, even he is silent, because now he has a housekeeper.

1376A*  How a Husband Cures His Wife of Fairy Tales (previously Story- teller Interrupted by Woman). The wife of an innkeeper loves to hear stories so much that she allows travelers who tell stories to stay for free at the inn (only storytellers to stay). This ruins the innkeeper and he wants to cure her of her habit. A traveler comes who offers to tell stories throughout the night on the condition that the woman does not interrupt him. But when he repeats the same story over and over she finally stops him. Her husband beats her for this breach of promise, and so she loses her interest in storytelling.

1380A*   The Petitioner Fooled (previously Wife to Spin). (Including the pre vi- ous Types 1380*, 1380**, 1388, 1575**, 1761*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a person (wife, young woman, maidservant, etc.) who asks a tree spirit (holy image) to grant some favor and to give a sign that this wish has been fulfilled. A trickster hiding behind (in) the tree or picture (the person affected by the wish, husband, employer, suitor, etc.) answers in a disguised voice, giving some unexpected information or saying something that furthers his own interest. The petitioner takes this reply as a divine command [K1971.3.1, K1971.4, K1971.5]. Cf. Types 1476, 1476A.

|1381      The Talkative Wife and the Discovered Treasure. A man (woman, boy) finds a treasure. Worried that his stupid (talkative) partner will say something that will cause him to lose the treasure, he pretends to his partner that something miraculous has happened: a rain of food, fish found in a field (in an animal trap), animals caught in a fish trap, the end of the world, a war of the birds, etc. When the stupid partner tells people that they found a treasure on the day it rained sausages, etc., no one believes what he says. The trick succeeds and the clever man keeps his treasure [J1151.1.1]. Cf. Type 1381A.

|1381A     Husband Discredited by Absurd Truth. A woman plants fish in the field where her husband is sure to plow them up. He finds them and gives them to her to cook. In the evening, in front of their guests, the woman asks her husband (so loudly that the neighbors can hear) what sort of fish he was talking of. When the guests hear the man say that it is the fish he found in his field, they think he is insane. He is restrained and taken to prison (madhouse), where he has to stay until his wife rescues him [J1151.1.2]. Cf. Types 1381, 1696.

|1381B     The Sausage Rain. A stupid boy commits a murder. His mother helps him hide the body in a well. In order to discredit her son’s testimony, the mother exchanges the body for that of an animal and stages a rain of sausages (figs, fish, milk). Because of the son’s talkativeness, investigators come and dis- cover the dead animal. The son insists that the murder took place on the day it rained sausages. The investigators think he is insane and release him [J1151.1.3]. Cf. Types 1381, 1600, and 1696.

|1381C     The Buried Sheep’s Head. In order to test his wife’s ability to keep a secret, a husband confides to his wife that he has killed a man and hidden the corpse. The woman does not know that he has killed an animal instead and hidden the carcass. When later they have a fight and the husband beats her, she re- veals the secret (tells it a friend who tells other people).

|1381E      Old Man Sent to School. An old man (farmer, workman, father) de- cides (is persuaded) to go to school in his old age (because he thinks it will help him become rich). On the way to school he finds a box (purse, bag) full of money. The man who lost it asks the old man if he found such a box, and the old man replies that he found it on the (first) day he went to school. The owner believes that it must have been a different box, because he lost his only recently. Cf. Type 1644.

|1381F*     Riding on the Sow. A farmer leaves home to go on a trip with his farmhand, but sends the man back to tell the farmwife not to let a certain man into the house. Knowing that this order will backfire, the farmhand tells her in- stead that her husband orders her not to ride on a sow. Curious, she disobeys, and the sow bites her on the toe (she falls of and hurts her self). Later on their trip, the farmer and the farmhand hear that a woman in their village was eaten by a sow [T254.2].

|1382       The Farmwife at the Market. A woman (man) takes a cow (ox, ram, butter, grain) and a chicken (rooster, eggs) to sell at the market. Be- cause she misunderstood her husband’s instructions, she sells the cow for the price of the chicken and demands in vain the price of the cow for the chicken. Finally she sells her wares for “what the market will bear” to a customer (Jew) who says he is “the market” (cf. Type 1541) and spits in her hand instead of giving her money. Or, she sells without receiv ing money and adds a pledge (skirt, silver belt, jewelry) (cf. Type 1385) or a deposit (a silver spoon). Or, she must go and collect the money herself and is tarred and feathered. She returns home con fused, does not even recognize herself (cf. Type 1383), and tells her husband what happened. He goes to the town with a fishing rod and pretends to fish in a gutter (well) until the man who cheated his wife passes by and mocks him for being as stupid as his wife. Thus the cheater is ex posed and the bargain is undone (renewed) [J1149.2].

|1386      Meat as Food for Cabbage. Before he leaves home a man tells his wife, “The meat is for the cabbage” (meaning that she should cook them together). The wife follows this advice literally and puts pieces of meat by each cabbage in the garden. When the man sees how stu pid his wife is, he leaves her. Usually he goes to look for other fools and meets people who do things even more stupid than what his wife did [J1856.1]. Cf. Types 1383, 1385, 1387, 1387*, 1450, and 1642.

|1387      The Woman Goes to Get Beer. (Including the previous Type 1387A.) A woman is sent to get some beer (wine). While she is in the cellar, the meat burns, or the dog takes it and runs away. She chases the dog but forgets to close the tap, and the beer runs out all over the cellar. The woman tries to cover up her mistake by strewing meal on the cellar floor [J2176, J2176.1]. Or, she throws bread out the window instead of putting it back in the oven [W111.3.3], so that the mowers will go home hungry. (Pre viously Type 1387A.)

|1387*     Woman Must Do Everything like Her Neighbors. A man marries a woman who has no idea how to do housework. He tells her to go to a neighbor and see how she does it. The wife watches the neighbor winnow wheat, scald clothes, and bake bread. She goes back home and winnows flour, scalds her husband’s fur coat and boots, and puts the calf in the oven, etc. Her husband gives her other instructions which she follows literally, with disasterous results.

|1391      Every Hole to Tell the Truth. (Les bijoux indiscrets.) A man helps a beggar (dervish, soldier) and receives as reward three magic objects, one of which is a stick that makes all holes able to speak. Before the man will marry a woman, he tests her chastity with this stick while she sleeps [D1610.6.1, H451, K1569.7]. Three women (daughters of a merchant, official, and nobleman) fail this test, and the man finally marries an “innocent” shepherdess. The fathers of the rejected women accuse him of slandering their daughters. They are tested again with the stick: the vagina of the first admits that it was unchaste. The second woman stuffs her va gina with hemp, but her anus speaks. The third silences her vagina and anus, but her ear admits to having had premarital intercourse.

1952, 88. The Foolish Husband and His Wife 1405–1429 

|1405      The Lazy Spinning Woman. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms, which appear alone or in combination: (1) A lazy wife lies to her husband, saying that she has spun many spindles of thread. But she always shows him the same spin dle. (2) As an excuse for not spinning, a wife tells her husband that she has no reel. He goes to the forest to get wood to make one for her. Afraid that she may have to work, the wife follows him secretly and hides. She calls out, “If anyone cuts wood for a reel, he (his wife) will die”. [K1971.4.1]. The man is frightened and goes back home without the wood. (3) A wife tells her husband that the thread she had spun has turned into hemp (has burned, was lost) through his negligence [J2325]: He should make sure that no birds fly over the house while she winds the thread. If they do, the thread will turn into shreds (be burned up). Or, when the thread is transported in a sack, the spin dles disappear (the thread turns into shreds). Cf. Type 1370B*.

They play various tricks on their husbands, causing them to do foolish things. For example, one wife convinces her husband that he is sick [J2317], dead [J2311.0.1], a dog [J2013.2], a monk [J2314], (he retreats into a monastery), a minister (he preaches in a church), or that he should have a healthy tooth pulled [J2324]. Another wife goes away for a week and convinces her husband it was only for a short time [J2315], that while he was absent, his house went elsewhere [J2316], or that he is wearing clothes when he is not [J2312], etc. Cf.

1406A*   Women’s Tricks are Better Than Men’s. A man claims to understand all women’s tricks. A clever woman decides to prove he is wrong. (He makes disparaging remarks about women in the hearing of a clever girl, who seeks revenge.) She makes the arrogant man fall in love with her and tells him she is the daughter of the king. When the man asks the king for the hand of his daughter, the king insists that his daughter is ugly and sick, but the man woos her anyway, marries her, and then discovers that he has been tricked into marrying the wrong woman. On the condition that he keeps her secret, the clever woman helps him out of this difficulty: he should tell the king that he is a Gypsy. The king annuls the marriage with his daughter, and the man marries the clever woman.

|1407      The Miser. A woman appears to eat nothing, but she does not lose weight. This appeals to a miserly man who decides to marry her. After some time he grows doubtful and spies on his wife. Instead of going to work, he hides in a cask (chimney). His mother-in-law arrives, sees where he is hiding, and tells her daughter she should pour hot water in the cask (light the hearth). When the husband re- covers from this injury, he is still distrustful and hides in bed to spy on his wife. His mother-in-law and his wife again know where he is and beat him [W153.2.1]. Cf.

|1407A     “Everything!” A miserly man marries a woman who pretends to eat nothing. When her husband is away, she eats three chickens (two ducks, a huge meal). When he returns the husband learns how much she ate and becomes sick from anger. On his death bed, he can say only, “My wife, all three (two, every thing)...” The wife (other relatives) hears only “three” (“two”, “everything”) and thinks that he is bequeathing her three things (properties, everything he owns) [cf. J1521.2, K1155]. In Swedish variants a miserly man (woman) becomes sick and sees that the maidservant takes too much to eat. The sick person wants to say that she had taken away everything from him, but can only produce the word, “Everything”, and this is understood to be his final will.

|1408      The Man Who Does His Wife’s Work. (Including the previous Type 1408A.) This type is usually a framework into which other anecdotes of stupid people are set. Its basic form is as follows: Following a quarrel in which the husband complains that he works hard while his wife stays comfortably at home, a married couple agree to exchange work. Or, the husband (son) is unable to work outside. His wife (moth er) must do the outdoor work for him, while he does the housework. Often, the wife gives her husband instructions about what work he should do. He does not pay attention and wastes half the day resting. The man tries to do several chores at once, and does everything wrong so that he suffers a series of accidents, e.g. he leans over the well while he is carrying the butterchurn on his back, so that the cream falls into the water (previously Type 1408A), he lets wine or beer run out of the cask and throws flour on top of it to dry the floor [J2176.1] (cf. Type 1387), he lets the cow graze on the roof [J2132.2] (cf. Type 1210), bathes the baby in boiling water [J2465.4] (cf. Type 1013), or demands that the pots walk home by themselves [J1881.1.3] (cf. Type 1291A), etc. When the wife returns home, she finds that her husband has made a mess and that everything is in chaos. The man admits that he had undervalued his wife’s work, and they agree that both of them should go back to their accustomed duties [J2431]. Or, the couple do not become reconciled: the wife beats her hus- band and drives him away. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with one or more other types, esp.

|1408B      Fault-Finding Husband Nonplussed. A husband is hypercritical and nothing his wife does pleases him. In order to give him no grounds for complaint, the wife cooks several dishes for dinner. Each time he objects to what she serves him, she is able to produce a substitute dish. When he grows more and more unhappy, she asks him what he could like to eat. He says, ”I want to eat – shit!” Shortly before, their child had relieved himself on a tablecloth, so she readily gives her husband what he asked for [J1545.3]. Cf. Type 1739A*.

|1408C      The String of Chickens. (Including the previous Type 1876.) A foolish husband is supposed to take care of the animals and the house while his wife is away. A hawk steals one of the chickens, so the wife beats her husband when she returns. When she goes away again, the husband vows to do better. He ties the chickens (and the chicks) all together with a string to protect them from predators. This enables the hawk to steal the whole flock at once.

|1409      The Obedient Husband. (Including the previous Types 1409A–1409C.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales (three sub types) dealing with a husband who follows his wife’s instructions literally and without thinking. Examples: (1) A husband is so compliant that he hangs his wife, although she had only been trying to test his willingness to obey her com mands [J2523.1]. (Previously Type 1409A.) (2) A wife (who insists on cleanliness) tells her husband (who has tracked dirt into the house) that he should go away for a while. The husband takes this command literally and goes away for many days. (Previously Type 1409B.) Or, after some time, he sends his friend to ask his wife if he has been gone long enough yet [J2523]. (3) A husband moves slowly at the request of his wife. Therefore he comes home only at dawn, after her lover is sure to have left [J2523.2]. (Previously Type 1409C.)

|1409*     The Woman Cooks the Dog for Dinner. A wife serves her husband cooked dog instead of a pig, because she ate the pig by herself. After the unsuspecting husband has finished eating, he looks for the dog as usual to give it the bones. His wife scoffs at him (tells him a wolf ate the dog).

|1410      Four Men’s Mistress. A jealous husband accuses his wife of adultery and, in order to confirm his suspicions, disguises himself as a priest to hear her confession. Recognizing him, she confesses that she has slept with a servant, a knight, a fool, and a man of God. When her angry husband identifies himself to her, she explains that all of these were himself: at first he served her, then he went to war, then his jealousy turned him into a fool, and now as a priest he has heard her confession [J1545.2].

|1415      Lucky Hans. Hans works for seven years and receives a lump of gold as big as a man’s head as his pay and goes home. Because he finds it too heavy to carry, he trades the gold for a horse, which throws him because he does not know how to ride. He trades the horse for a cow, the cow for a hog, the hog for a goose, the goose for a whetstone, which through his awkwardness falls into a well [J2081.1]. Unen- cumbered but happy, he arrives home.

|1416      The Mouse in the Silver Jug. A poor married couple bemoans life’s harshness and blame Adam and Eve who through their disobedi ence and curiosity brought sin into the world. The king (rich man) hears their complaint and invites the poor couple into his house to live in luxury. He stipulates only that they must not open any covered vessel [C324]. They cannot resist the temptation and re move the cover from a dish. A mouse jumps out [H1554.1] (a bird flies out). The king reproves the disobedient couple and sends them back to their old way of life.

|1418      The Equivocal Oath. (Isolde’s Ordeal.) A (guilty) woman whose hus- band accuses her of adultery clears herself under oath and by ordeal (wearing a red-hot iron without being hurt) by means of a trick: She summons her lover, who appears disguised as a pilgrim (donkey driver) and carries her from the boat dock to the lawcourt. She makes sure that the two of them fall to the ground (she falls off the donkey) and her lover lands on top of her (sees under her skirt). At the trial, she swears honestly that no one except her husband and the pilgrim (driver) has ever lain on top of her (has ever seen her naked). Because what she swore under oath was true, she is not burned by the red-hot iron used for the ordeal [K1513]. 

Remarks: Famous for its connection with Virgil’s legendary biography and for its  
depiction in the Roman Bocca della verità, as well as its place in the romance of  
Tristan and Isolde which has been popular since the High Middle Ages.

|1418*        The Confession (previously The Father Overhears). A young bride (wife) confesses to her bridegroom (husband) that she has had sexual relations with another man (has an illegitimate child, after her bride- groom had confessed to her that he too has an illegitimate child). The bridegroom complains to his prospective father-in-law (and leaves her). The two men send the mother to the bride to speak to her about the matter, and hide so that they can listen to the conversation. The bride confesses to her mother about her sexual experience (illegit- im ate child). Her mother tells her that she also had lovers before she was married (had three illegitimate children), but never told her husband about them. (Her husband, overhearing, decides to follow  his son-in-law and leave his wife.)

|1419         The Returning Husband Hoodwinked. (Including the previous Type 1419K*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a husband who returns home to an adulterous wife, who further deceives him. Examples: (1) While her husband is absent a wife commits adultery with a servant (scribe, farmhand, cook, fisherman). The two are sur prised by the husband’s sudden return. The wife tells her lover not to wor- ry and to wait in the garden, and goes quickly to her husband. He suspects something is amiss and asks where the servant is. She sug- gests he should wear women’s clothes and go and look for him. The husband does so and finds the servant in the garden. The servant slaps him and tells him that a woman should not cheat on her hus- band. The husband is reassured and rewards the servant for his good morals [K1510]. (2) When her husband comes home suddenly, a wife quickly hides  her lover in a chest [K1521.2] (featherbed, cupboard, suitcase). A betraying part of his body (clothing) hangs out, and she manages to warn him indirectly to pull it in. Later he escapes. (Previously 1419K*.) Cf. Types 1419A–H, and 1419J*.

|1419E     Underground Passage to Lover’s House. (Inclusa.) (Including the pre- vious Type 1419E*.) A knight and a lady dream of each other and fall in love [T11.3]. He finds her in a tower behind ten locked doors. Her husband always keeps the key with him. The knight joins his service and, having earned his respect, is permitted to build a house next to the tower. The knight has a tunnel constructed between his house and the tower, and to ensure secrecy, he kills the architect. He is able easily to visit his lover, who gives him her ring. When the husband sees that the knight has this ring, he becomes suspicious. He goes quickly to his wife, who, because of the tunnel, now has the ring herself. Later the knight introduces the wife to her husband as his (i.e. the knight’s) wife. The husband again is suspicious, but, because of the tunnel, finds his wife back where she belongs. In the end the husband is so confused that he cannot recognize himself any more (previously Type 1419E*). He is tricked into marrying his wife off to the knight, without recognizing who she is. The couple es capes safely away on a ship [K1344, K1523].

The woman agrees and they sleep to                          - gether. He refuses to give her the goose because, he says, she had more pleasure than he did for she had taken the upper position. After a second copulation in a different position, he claims that now they are even. While they are fighting about this, the woman’s husband comes and is told that they were quarreling about the price of the goose. He settles the fight by paying for the goose, and is thus doubly swindled.

|1422       Parrot Reports Wife’s Adultery (previously Parrot Unable to Tell Husband Details of Wife’s Infidelity). (Including the previous Type 243.) A parrot (another bird) tells a man that his wife is an adulteress. When the husband has to go on a journey, he orders the parrot to give him a report on his wife’s behavior when he returns. The wife and her maidservant plan a trick: in the night they pour water through a hole in the roof onto the parrot, throw things at him, blind him with mirrors, and make noise like thunder. When the husband returns, the weather has been fine, but the parrot com plains about the thunderstorm. Hearing what he believes to be a false hood, the angry husband disbelieves everything the parrot says, and kills him [J1154.1]. In some variants the husband goes up on the roof and discovers evidence of the deceit. He forgives his wife, kills her, or falls into despair. Cf. Type 243A.

|1423      The Enchanted Pear Tree. With her husband nearby, a wife climbs up a tree ostensibly to pick fruit but really to meet her lover. The rest of the anecdote follows one of two patterns: (1) Although the husband sees his wife together with her lover, she convinces him that this was an optical illusion caused by the magic power of the tree (window, other objects). (2) The husband is old and blind and therefore very suspicious and jealous. In his delusion of love he embraces the trunk of the tree in order to protect his wife’s virtue from the eyes of passers-by. At the critical moment, God (Jesus, Jupiter, St. Peter) restores his eye sight. He cries out in surprise, and his wife realizes what has hap pen ed. She assuages his anger by pointing out that her arborial adul  tery provided the means of restoring his eyesight [K1518].

|1424      Friar Adds Missing Nose (fingers) to unborn child. (Including the pre vious Type 1726*.) A clergyman (neighbor, friend) seduces a preg- nant woman by telling her that her fetus has not been construct ed properly by her husband. He offers to add the missing parts (nose, ears, head, limbs) for her [K1363.2]. In some variants, the tale continues: When the husband returns home, he thanks the clergyman for his help. Or, the husband takes revenge by inviting the clergyman and his daughter to dinner. He steals the daughter’s ring and convinces that it has gone inside her body. He offers to retrieve it by having sex with her, and she agrees [K1315.2.2].

She goes into the wilderness where she finds a hermit and asks him what she must do to lead a pious life. The hermit tells her about God’s greatest enemy, the devil, whom people who love God must send back down to hell. He tells her his penis is the devil, and that instead of a devil she has a hell. Thus she is seduced into helping him send the devil into hell, believ ing that this will serve God [K1363.1].

|1426      The Wife Kept in a Box. (Including the previous Type 1426*.) Two brothers (kings, knight and king, friends) discover that their wives have lovers. Hoping to distance themselves from this problem, the brothers set out on a journey. They meet a man (fakir, demon, etc.) who carries a small case (shrine) with him. When the man takes a rest, he opens the case and a beautiful woman comes out. The couple enjoy themselves and the man goes to sleep. The woman then seduces the two travelers. (Or, she also releases a lover from such a case that she carried with her.) So the brothers (the man himself [previously Type 1426*]) realize that even a well- guarded woman can betray her husband, and go back home know ing that there is no way to prevent women’s treachery [T382, F1034.2.1, J882.2].

This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A poor married couple (father and son, two brothers, herds- men, maidservants, other people) plan to turn their possessions (glassware, milk, honey, eggs, money) into great wealth (herds of ani mals, houses). As they imagine this wealth, they destroy what they already have [J2060, J2060.1, J2061, J2061.1.1, J2061.2, J2061.1, J2061.1.2]. (2) A person (poor man, hunter, Gypsy, married couple) dreams of having a valuable possession (catch from hunting, etc.), which he then tries to obtain. His efforts fail because he imagines his success (e.g. the hunter is so excited that he frightens his prey). (3) A married couple (other people) imagine that they will obtain the means to achieve future wealth, but they disagree about how to manage it. One wants to keep reinvesting the future profits, while the other wants to enjoy part of the wealth.

|1431      The Contagious Yawns. A man notices that his wife and a farmhand yawn one after the other, and sees in this evidence of adultery. Plan- ning to hang his supposedly-unfaithful wife, he takes a rope and goes with her into the forest. He runs from one tree to another, trying to find one suitable for his purpose. The wife follows him and says that he behaves just like a rabbit (squirrel, bird) jumping all around. She tells him that his behavior is just like people’s yawns, which go from one person to another. This cures the husband of his suspicions, and the couple go back home together [J1448].

1453**** The Flatulent Girl (previously Puella pedens). A young woman (wife) who farts easily creates embarrassing situations. A suitor observes her secretly and counts her farts. Or, she tries to cure her problem by stopping up her backside with the alarm whistle of the fire department. As she dances, the whistle plays, and the other people think a fire has broken out. In some variants, the shoemaker’s wife farts so horribly that her husband stops up her backside with tar and leather. To prevent her from bursting, he makes a small hole in the leather with his awl. This is the origin of organ pipes (wind instruments).

|1501     Aristotle and Phyllis. An aged philosopher (Aristotle) warns his stu- dent (Alexander the Great) against letting himself be dominated by his wife. Alexander withdraws from his wife (Phyllis, Roxane, Can- dacis, Campaspe). In revenge the neglected queen makes the phil- osopher fall in love with her and he pursues her with proposals. Pretending  to  woo  him,  she  demands  that  he  crawls  on  his hands and knees and let her ride on his back. Alexander surprises Aristotle  in this undignified position [K1215]. Ashamed, the philoso- pher an swers quickly that he was trying to warn Alexander against such fool ishness. Alexander forgives Aristotle and continues to fol- low his teachings (Aristotle is so ashamed that he has to leave the country ). 

Remarks: The oldest version (with other actors) is a Buddhist tale from China from  
the year 516 C.E. Documented in Europe since the early 13th century.

|1503*     The Daughter-in-Law and the Real Daughter. A mother favors her own daughter, whom she thinks is more diligent than her daughter- in-law, although actually the reverse is true. For example she praises her daughter for spinning a big spool every week, and she criticizes her daughter-in-law for spinning only one small spool per day. She does not see that seven small spools are more than one big one.

|1510      The Matron of Ephesus. (Vidua.) (Including the previous Type 1352*.) A woman mourns her dead husband by his grave (in his tomb, in a house nearby) and is completely inconsolable. Near the cemetery a soldier (knight) guards a gallows on which a man has been hanged. One cold night the soldier leaves his post and visits (spends the night with) the widow. When he returns, he finds that the corpse which he was sup- posed to guard has been stolen. In order to prevent him from being punished, the widow offers to have her husband’s body exhumed and substituted for the one on the gallows (the soldier proposes this) [K2213.1]. (The soldier promises to marrry her. The woman knocks her husband’s teeth out, in order to make the body like that of the stolen corpse. The soldier punishes the woman for her callousness by refusing to marry her [T231.4].) Cf. Type 1350.

|1511*     Advice of the Bells. A woman (widow) who wants to marry her farmhand asks the priest what he thinks of this idea. He advises her to listen to the bells. She believes they recommend the marriage. Her husband turns out to be a heavy drinker, and the wife complains to the priest. He advises her again to listen to the bells. Now these tell her not to marry the farmhand, but it is too late. In some variants, it is a young man who listens to the advice of the bells. His wife’s obstinate nature makes his life difficult. In the end he manages to subdue her.

|1515       The Weeping Bitch. (Catala.) A merchant (knight) goes on a journey (pilgrimage). He leaves his faithful wife alone and unsupervised. A young man falls in love with her, but she rejects his advances. Sick with love, he goes to an old woman (nun) who promises to help. The old woman gives her female dog nothing to eat for two days, and on the third day gives it food cooked with mustard (pepper), which makes its eyes water. The old woman (often disguised as a nun or dervish [K1837]) takes this “weeping” dog with her to visit the wife whom the young man loves. When the wife asks what is the matter with the dog, the old woman at first does not reply. Then she tells the wife that the dog is actually her daughter (sister), who turn ed into an animal because she did not reciprocate a man’s love. The young wife believes this false story and asks the old woman to ar range a meeting for her with the young man [K1351]. The go-between cannot find the lovesick young man but does not want to lose her payment for arranging the meeting. She meets a man (who happens to be the husband, returning home) and offers him an assignation. When the wife recognizes her husband, she berates him and accuses him of adulterous intentions. She pretends to have set up the situation as a test. Thus she is exonerated, her husband is made  to seem to be an adulterer, and the old woman loses her payment.

|1516*     Marriage as Purgatory (previously Pleasant Purgatory). (Including the previous Types 1516A*–1516D*.) Cf. Type 165B*. Miscellaneous type. Four important forms can be distinguished: (1) A dead man would rather remain in purgatory than return to his quarrelsome wife on earth (would rather not go to heaven because he does not want to be with his wife). (2) A shepherd compares his own sorry situation with the cruci- fixion: Christ suffered on the cross for only a few hours. Being mar- ried would have been a real punishment for him [T251.0.2], es pecially if he had had children and no money to buy them pre sents for Easter. (Previously Type 1516A*.) (3) An old man comes to the door of heaven and St. Peter asks him what he did on earth. He answers that he was married. Peter lets him come right in because he already suffered his time in purga tory. A second man, who overheard this exchange, also wants to enter heaven. He tells Peter that he was married twice. Peter tells him that there is no place in heaven for such fools [T251.0.1]. (Pre viously Types 1516B* and 1516C*.) (4) A priest demands payment from a man for having performed his marriage. The man proposes that he “unmarry” him instead. (Previously Type 1516D*.)

|1525A      Tasks for a Thief (previously Theft of Dog, Horse, Sheet, or Ring). A good-for-nothing young man from a poor family learns the craft of stealing and comes home as a master thief. He (his father) boasts about his skill in front of the earl (godfather) [K301.1, F660.1, H915], who demands (usually) three tests [H1151]. (1) The master thief steals a horse (dog) out of a closely-guarded stall [H1151.2]. He disguises himself as an old woman (beggar) and gives liquor (a drug) to the farmhands (guards, soldiers) to make them sleep [K332]. (2) He steals the bedcover (shirt) and wedding ring of the earl’s wife [H1151.3, H1151.4]. He contrives that the earl shoots a corpse (straw man) and goes to bury the body. The thief tells the earl’s wife that the earl needs the blanket and ring for the corpse [K362.2]. (3) He traps the priest and the sexton in a sack (cf. Type 1737) and puts candles on the backs of crabs. The men take him for an angel and the lights for wandering souls (cf. Type 1740). He carries the sack to the goose house (hangs it in the bell tower or chimney). Cf. Type 1737. After these tests, the master thief is banished from the country (pardoned, rewarded). Cf. Type 328.

|1525B     The Horse Stolen. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A thief pretends to show how a horse can be stolen, but ac- tually he steals the horse himself. In some variants something else is stolen (shoes, clothing, a watch, dishes, purse, meat, etc.) [K341.8]. Cf. Types 1540, 1542. (2) In a German version the horse is stolen in a different way. A rider meets a poor beggar who asks him to retrieve his crutch, which a prankster (bad boy) had hung up in a tree. When the rider climbs the tree, the pretended cripple jumps on his horse and rides away. 

Combinations: 1525A, 1542. 
Remarks: Version (2) is documented in the 17th centuries. In different regions, it  
has crystalized around actors such as Eulenspiegel or famous noble robbers like  
Schinderhannes or Rinaldo Rinaldi.

|1525D      Theft by Distracting Attention. A master thief (apprentice) steals an ox (ram) of a farmer (farmhand) who is going to market. The thief drops first one, then the other, of a pair of matched objects (shoes, boots, sword and sheath, knife and fork) in the road [K341.6]. The farmer passes by the first object but, when he sees the second, he goes back for the first, leaving his animal behind. The thief takes the animal. Other tricks are also used to distract the farmer’s attention: the master thief pretends to hang himself in the forest [K341.3] (pretends to be dead). Or he imitates the cry of the farmer’s animal [K341.7] or sets a rabbit (chicken) free. In other variants one of the thieves takes the bell off a sheep that is following a donkey. He ties the bell to the donkey’s tail and steals the sheep. A second thief steals the donkey by offering to take care of it while the owner goes to look for his missing sheep.

|1525E      Thieves Steal from One Another (previously The Thieves and their Pupil). (Including the previous Types 1525H, 1525H –1525H , and                                                           1          3 1525N.) Thieves (robbers) test their expertise through a contest in which they steal from each other [K306]. Or a new member of a band of robbers has to demonstrate his skill and outdoes his teacher [L142.1]. Cf. Type 700. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) One thief steals an egg out of a bird’s nest without disturbing the bird. A second thief steals the same egg from the breast (pants pocket) of the first, or steals the trousers (shoe soles) off him while he climbs up to get the egg. Or the first thief takes off his cloth in or- der to get the egg, and the second thief steals the cloth. (Previously Type 1525H1.) Cf. Type 653. (2) Two thieves steal a ham (butchered hog, goat) from the wife of a former member of their band. This man steals the ham from them, and finally they steal it back again [K306.1]. (Previously Type 1525H , 1525H .) 2          3 (3) Two thieves trick each other. First, they exchange supposed- ly valuable sacks which turn out to contain only worthless things (sand, hay, etc.) [J1516]. Next, they exchange jobs (tending an un man- ageable cow, carrying water in a leaky pot, etc.) because each thinks the other’s work is easier, and both come to grief [J2431.1, K1687]. Together they find (steal) a treasure and each tries to trick the other out of his share. One hides in a chest, and the other, be lieving it to be full of gold, carries it home [K307.1]. (Previously Type 1525N.) 

Combinations: 950, 1525A, 1525D, 1641, 1654, and 1737. 
Remarks: Versions (1) and (2) first appear in the 13th–14th century (Jean de Boves,   
De Barat et de Haimet ou des trois larrons). Recent examples of version (1) have  
spread from southeastern and eastern Europe; of version (2), from northern and  
eastern Europe. Version (3) is known primarily in India, the Near East, east ern  
and southeastern Europe, and northern and eastern Africa.

|1525H    The Youth in the Beehive. A boy (thief, boaster, fool, Eulenspiegel, 4 couple) hides (falls asleep drunk) in an empty beehive. Two thieves come at night to steal the bees and weigh all the hives. Believing that the heaviest is the best, they carry off the one with the boy in it. He pulls the hair of one of them, who gets angry at his companion for bothering him. Then the boy pulls the hair of the other thief, who also blames his companion. The boy continues this until the thieves put down the hive to fight each other. In some variants the boy (man) does not bother the thieves. They take the hive and build a fire under it. When the boy cries out, they are frightened and run away [K335.1.6.3]. 

Combinations: 1829, 1875.

|1525J      Thieves Cheated of Their Booty. (Including the previous Types 1525J                                                                             1 and 1525J2 .) Cf. Types 1525D, 1525E, 1653, 1654, 1875. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) An uncle and his nephew (grandfather and grandson, group of thieves) steal an ox (sheep) and roast it. The nephew (apprentice thief) wants to keep all the meat for himself. He takes the hide to a waterhole. Hiding in the bushes, he beats the hide as if he himself were being beaten. He cries and shouts that it was not he but his uncle  who stole the ox. The uncle thinks that the boy has been caught, so he runs away [K335.1.3]. In some variants the thieves cut the tail (head) off the ox (sheep) and stick it in the mouth (backside) of another, so that it looks as if one ox has eaten the other. Or they put the severed part in a swamp [K404.1]. When the owner swims out to get his drowned animal, they steal his clothes. Cf. Type 1004. (2) A boy (woman) tells a passing thief (soldier) that he has lost a silver cup (pail, etc.) in the well (river), and asks him to get it back for him. The thief takes off his clothes, climbs in the well, and finds nothing. When he comes back up, he finds that his clothes have been stolen [K345.2].

|1526      The Old Beggar and the Robbers. Swindlers (thieves, Gypsies, female trickster) dress a beggar (foolish farmer) as a noble lord. (They take him to an inn and pretend to be his servants.) They steal from one or more merchants by saying that their master will pay for what they take (they say they will get money from their master). Leaving the man hostage in the inn or with the merchants, the swindlers leave with their spoils. The “noble” lord is discovered to be a beggar. He is either punished or permitted to leave [K455.3]. Cf. Type 1531. 

Combinations: 1737, 1829. 
Remarks: Documented in a German verse tale of the early 13th century by Stricker  
(Der Pfaffe Amîs). In the 18th and 19th centuries, disseminated through popular theatrical productions, in connection with particular well-known robbers  
(Schinder hannes, Cartouche, Antrašek and Juratšek). In oriental tradition the  
trickster is always female (Dalīla, Fatma, Aicha).

|1526A     Supper Won by a Trick. Three (four) tricksters (thieves, students, sol- diers) want some supper. They have no money, so they obtain their food through (three) successive tricks. Usually someone else has to pay for their food. In some variants a single trickster gets a free meal through one of various tricks, e.g. by pretending that he is an invited guest [K455.1, K455.2, K455.4]. Cf. Type 1920E.

1526A** Waiting until the Tower Falls. Two men (students, farmhands) in an inn look out of the window and see that the churchtower is lop sided. They wager as to which side the tower will fall toward, to east or to west. The loser has to pay for the meal (wine). They enjoy their meal. When later the innkeeper asks for the payment they tell him, he has to wait until the tower falls.

|1527A      The  Robber  Disarmed  (previously  Robber  Induced  to  Waste  his Ammu nition). This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A boy in the forest comes upon a robber who takes his sword and robs him. The boy asks the robber to cut off his hand, to make it appear that the boy had fought to defend himself. When the rob- ber swings the sword, the boy pulls his hand back and the sword be comes stuck in a tree trunk. The boy pulls the sword out and kills the robber [K630]. (2) A robber attacks a farmer (merchant) and takes his money. The victim asks the robber to shoot his hat (clothes) so that it will ap pear that the robber had to use considerable force. When the robber has used up all his ammunition, the farmer chases him away with his stick [K724].

|1527*     Night Lodging Requisitioned (previously The Three Wanderers Seek Night Lodgings). Three travelers need a place to spend the night. After they are turned away by an innkeeper, one of them climbs up to the roof and stops the chimney with his coat, so that the inn fills with smoke. (The other guests leave and) the innkeeper lets the travelers stay there (for free).

|1528      Holding  Down  the  Hat.  This  tale  exists  chiefly  in  two  different forms: (1) A merchant is chasing a thief who stole from him. Disguised as a farmer, the thief stands by the side of the road pretending to be guarding a valuable falcon which he has hidden under his hat. When the merchant comes by, the “farmer” offers to chase the thief, if the merchant will guard the falcon and lend him his horse. The merchant pays him for helping, and the thief keeps the horse in addition. Cf. Type 1540. (2) A man defecates by the side of a road and covers the pile with his hat. When a priest comes by, the man explains that he has caught a beautiful bird. He sells the “bird” to the priest with the condition that he should not pick up the hat until the man is out of sight. After the man has left, the priest reaches under the hat to grasp the bird, and finds only a handful of feces [K1252].

Remarks: Documented in Germany in the early 14th century (Neidhart mit dem  
Veilchen). In the 19th and 20th centuries, the tale has become purely humorous;  
some of its old motifs have disappeared and have been replaced by others from  
other anecdotes.

|1529      Thief as Donkey (previously Thief Claims to have been Transformed into a Horse). A clever thief (student, beggar, traveling monk) steals a donkey (horse, mule, ox, cow) that had been tied up (to a tree or hedge, behind a wagon) or saddled or yoked. He leaves his compan- ion in place of the stolen animal. The companion convinces the owner (farmer, minister, pilgrim) that he had been turned into the animal as a punishment for his sins (for cursing his father or moth er). The period of his punishment is now over and he has become human again [K403]. The owner of the animal believes this and lets him go free (and often apologizes for having beaten or insulted him, and gives him hospitality or money). The owner goes to buy a new donkey at the market, where he finds his old animal. Believing that this is his acquaintance, the owner  reproaches him for having sinned again, and refuses to buy the ani- mal.

1529A*   The Exchange of Horses. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A gentleman agrees to exchange his good horse for the poor horse of a farmer, provided the farmer will eat its dung. The farmer does so and discovers valuables in the dung. (2) A gentleman (Englishman) agrees to give a farmer (Russian) a cow (his fortune) if the farmer will eat a frog. The farmer succeeds in eating half, and offers the other half to the gentleman to eat if he wants to keep the cow (the Russian fulfills the condition but the Englishman cannot; so he does not get back his fortune).

|1532      The Voice from the Grave. Two swindlers hear of a wealthy man who has died recently. One of them takes the dead man’s place and is buried (hides near the grave). The other finds the relatives of the dead man and tells them that the man had borrowed a large amount of money from him. Asking that they repay the money, he suggests that they verify the debt by asking the dead man. They do so and the confederate answers from his hiding place that the debt must be paid [K451.5, K1974]. The swindler who takes the money goes away, leaving his confederate still buried in the ground. Cf. Type 1676.

|1533      The Wise Carving of the Fowl [H601]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A poor man (farmer, clever man) brings his master (ruler) a chicken (dove, goose, etc.) as a present. The master asks him to di vide the bird appropriately among the members of his household. The poor man gives the master the head and his wife the neck, be cause the head and the neck belong together (the wife the rump, be cause she sits at home, or the heart). He gives the two sons the legs, because they work outside the house to support the household, and the two daughters the wings, because they will fly away. He takes the body for himself. The master rewards him well for his wisdom. Cf. Type 875. Sometimes the tale continues: A neighbor hears of the poor man’s good fortune. He brings the master a present of five chickens along with rice. When he is asked to divide these appropriately he cannot do so, and he is beaten. (2) Sometimes as a conclusion to the version above: A master asks the poor man to divide (these) five chickens (other birds) among the members of his household. The poor man gives the master and his wife one bird, to make three. Likewise he gives one to the two sons and one to the two daughters. Finally he takes the last two for himself, to make another set of three. Cf. Type 1663.

|1533A     Hog’s Head Divided According to Scripture. A clergyman, a sexton, and a schoolmaster (three students) want to divide a roasted pig (a pig’s head) among themselves. The criterion for the division is their skill in quoting Scripture. The minister cuts off an ear and says, “So Peter cut off an ear from the servant of the high priest”. The sexton cuts the head off the pig (the second ear) and says, “So was the head of John the Baptist cut off” (“and they gave him a box on the ear”). The schoolmaster considers for a long time. Finally he spreads a cloth and puts the rest of the pig (head) on it and says, “And then they took the holy body away”. [J1242.1]. In some variants, three monks find a single egg and agree that it should go to the one who gives the most appropriate quote from the Bible. The first says, “Purify it from the shell of falsehood”. The second says, “Sprinkle it with the salt of wisdom”. The third says, “Come in to praise the Lord!” and eats the egg. Cf. Type 1626.

|1533B     The Third Egg. A farmer’s son who is studying philosophy (medi cine) has returned home. One day two eggs (fowls, pancakes) are served for dinner. In order to show off his education, he explains that these are not two but three: “This is one, that makes two, and together they are three”. His father refrains from contradicting him. He takes one egg for himself, gives the second to his wife, and in vites his son to eat the third egg [J1539.2].

|1533C     The Clever Division of the Herd. A man (farmer, Turk, Arab) leaves his three sons (nephews, farmhands) a total of 17 cows (horses, camels, coins) to be divided as follows: the oldest son is to have half; the mid- dle son, one third; and the youngest, one ninth. They are unable to solve this problem until a bystander adds one of his own animals to the herd. From 18 animals, each son can take his proper inheritance, and then the bystander takes his own animal back [J1249].

|1534      Series of Clever Unjust Decisions. (The Decisions of Shemjaka.) A poor man (merchant, baker) causes a series of accidents: He pulls off the tail of a (borrowed) horse (one of two oxen that he has borrowed dies). The owner sues him. The poor man flees into a house and frightens (hits) a pregnant woman so that she miscarries. Or a woman invites him in out of the rain, and he sits on her sofa and accidentally kills her child. Her husband (the woman) sues him as well. Out  of  desperation,  the  poor  man  jumps  from  a  high  tower (bridge ) and kills a passer-by [N320, N330], whose brother (other relative) sues him. The injured parties bring the poor man before a judge. The judge decides as follows [J1173]: The poor man should keep the borrowed horse until its tail grows back. He should impregnate the mother with another child (and her husband should hit her again, to give her another miscarriage). Her husband rejects this settlement and withdraws his suit. (In some variants, he has to pay a fine to the poor man.) The brother (other relative) of the killed man should jump from the tower upon the poor man in order to kill him. He also with- draws his suit. (In some variants he also has to pay a fine to the poor man.) (The poor man leaves with the horse and his settlements.) Some variants have a frame tale: The judge persuades a baker (mer chant) to give him a goose (duck) that belongs to someone else. He promises to protect him if the owner of the goose accuses him of theft. Then as above. Cf. Types 926C.

|1534A     The Innocent Man Condemned to Death (previously The Innocent Man Chosen to Fit the Stake [Noose]). A holy man and his disciple come to a city where the king and all his ministers are fools, and where all kinds of food are sold for the same price [J342.1.1, X1503.3]. The holy man leaves at once and warns his disciple to do so too, but the disciple stays despite the warning [N347.7]. A thief tries to break into a house at night but is killed when the wall collapses (he puts his eye out on a projecting stick). The house- holder is called before the king and sentenced to death (to have his eye put out). The householder, however, blames the mason who built the wall who, in turn, blames the man who supplied the mor tar, etc., until finally one man is found who is too stupid to find some  one else to blame. He is condemned to death [J2233]. The owner explains that he needs both his eyes for his work, but his neighbor, who is a hunter, needs only one. The hunter says he really needs both eyes, but his neighbor, who is a musician, always closes his eyes when he plays, etc. The king decrees that one of his eyes be put out. Cf. Type 978. The condemned man is too thin to fit the stake (noose). The dis- ciple is chosen to be executed in his place [N178.2]. The holy man returns and announces that he has discovered that the next man to be executed will go directly to heaven [K841.1, J1189.3]. The king leaps upon the stake himself [K842.4, K843]. Cf. Type 980*.

The angry plaintif protests that the man is not dumb, and that he had given him a loud warning. Thus the plaintif loses his case, because he did not heed the man’s warning [K1656].

|1535      The Rich and the Poor Farmer. (Unibos.) This tale often begins with one of the following episodes: (1) The family of a poor man (farmer) kills their only cow (two oxen) and uses all their flour to bake bread. They invite all the vil- lagers to a big dinner. The family waits in vain for a return invitation from the guests. (2) A rich man kills his poor brother’s only horse, and gives him its skin. Main part: The poor man goes to the city to sell the cowhide (oxhide, horse- hide). During the night he discovers the innkeeper’s wife with her lover and threatens to expose them. They bribe him not to tell. Or, a merchant believes that the poor man’s sacks of refuse contain valu- ables. The merchant takes the sacks, and in return leaves his goods for the poor man. Back at home, the poor man tells his rich brother (the villagers) that he received all the money for the animal hide (the refuse). The brother (villagers) kills all his cattle in order to sell their hides, and im poverishes himself (tries to sell refuse and is beaten). In some variants the rich man is angry and tries to kill his brother, but instead he kills an old relative (dead man) who is lying in his place in bed. The poor man takes the corpse away, and con vinces an innocent man that he killed the person. This man bribes the poor man not to tell. Then the poor man claims that he had sold the corpse. Cf. Types 1536C, 1537. The rich man kills all his relatives, hoping to sell their corpses. He is put in prison and set free after he serves his sentence. Still angry, he tries to drown his brother. The poor brother, con- fined in a sack (chest), finds a passer-by (shepherd, rich lord) who is willing to trade places with him. After this person has been thrown into the water, the poor man comes back to the village with the sheep (horse, riches) and claims he found them under the water. The jealous rich man (the villagers) jumps into the water and drowns. Cf. Types 1539, 1737.

|1536         Disposing of the Corpse. The motif of having to get rid of a corpse [K2151] appears in a series of different narratives. It has different results depending on its situation in the tale. This type combines epi sodes particularly from types 1536A and 1537.

|1536A        The Woman in the Chest. A poor brother (neighbor, sexton) steals a hog (cow, food) from his rich brother (neighbor, clergyman). The rich man suspects his brother, but wants to be certain, so he hides his mother-in-law (mother, wife, cook) in a chest (cupboard) in his broth  er’s house to spy. Cf. Type 1360C. The  woman  confirms  the  rich  man’s  suspicion  and  cries  out (curses, makes noise). The poor brother opens the chest, strangles  the woman (kills her in some other way), and puts some food (cheese, meat, sausage, bread) in her mouth. The rich brother opens the chest, sees that the woman is dead, and thinks she has suffocated. He wants to keep her death secret and bribes the poor brother not to tell any one and to bury her. Later, the poor brother digs her up at night (keeping some of her valuables) and sets her body at his brother’s door, where it falls over when the door is opened in the morning. The rich brother thinks the corpse has returned to haunt him [K2151, K2321]. Cf. Type 1537. He pays his poor brother more money to bury the corpse again (often three or four times), but it turns up in the barn, close to the well, on a foal that follows the rich man, etc. The poor man gets so much money (cattle, provisions) for reburying the body that he be- comes as rich as (richer than) his brother.

|1536B     The Three Hunchback Brothers Drowned. There are two parts to this tale. The first part exists in two forms, but the second part is largely the same. (1) Three hunchbacked musicians are asked by the wife of an other hunchbacked man to play some music. (One of the three hunch- backed brothers marries a rich widow, and his poor brothers visit her uninvited.) The husband unexpectedly comes home. The musi- cians hide in a chest (oven, cellar), where they die [N320] (kill each other). (2) Three monks (clergymen, knights, students) court a beautiful woman. On the advice of her husband, she invites them to visit her. The visit of the first lover is interrupted by that of the second, etc., and they hide in a chest (oven, cellar). The third lover hides when the husband arrives. The husband kills them in their hiding place [K1551.1]. Cf. Type 1730. A drunken man (stupid farmhand, farmer, porter, undertaker, beggar, soldier, the devil) is employed to dump one of the dead bodies into the river (to bury it). When he returns, he finds the sec                                   - ond body in the same place as if it had come back from the dead, and then the third. After he gets rid of all three bodies, he meets the hunchbacked husband (another monk, clergyman, knight) and,  think ing that this is another revenant, kills him and dumps him into the river (buries him) also. Cf. Type 1537.

|1536C         The Murdered Lover. A woman wants to meet her lover without her husband’s knowledge. She asks a neighbor (God, saint) for advice, and is told (by her husband hiding in the church or behind the saint’s picture) that she should give her husband a particular food that will make him blind (and deaf). She does so and he pretends to be blind. When the wife receives her lover, her husband finds an oppor tunity to kill him (and puts some food in his mouth to make it look as if he choked on it). Cf. Type 1380. The husband brings the body of the lover back home (to a shop, inn) and asks in a disguised voice if he may come in. The wife (the shopkeeper) thinks her husband (a drunk) is at the door, and tells him to spend the night with his mistress (to go home). The woman refuses to open the door even when the man says he will die (hang himself). The husband leans the corpse against the door (hangs it on the door). In some variants the woman (repeatedly) has the body delivered to another place where it is “killed” again by someone else (thief, etc.). Cf. Types 1535, 1537.

|1537      The Corpse Killed Five Times. A certain woman’s lover (often a clergy- man or a monk) is killed by her angry husband, or a man (clergy man, occasionally a woman) is killed by accident (on purpose, is mur- dered). The wife (married couple, bystanders, murderer) se cretly leaves the body by the neighbors’ door. The neighbor thinks it is a robber (adulterer) and “kills” it again. To cover up this murder, the neighbor takes the body to a monas- tery (and puts it in the abbot’s room, or on a toilet), where it is “killed ” again because it will not speak [K2152]. This “murderer” puts the body into a sack and throws it into the river. Fishermen find it and hang it in a shop (put it in a boat or on a sledge, or tie it on a horse and drive it into a field or into a crockery shop), and the shop keeper “kills”’ it again [K2151]. Cf. Type 1536C. Often the trickster (the first murderer) blackmails the subsequent “murderers” for not exposing their “murders”. Cf. Type 1536A. 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with one or more other types, esp.  
1000, 1013, 1380, 1525D, 1535, 1536A, 1536B, 1537*, 1539, 1643, 1653, 1792, and  
1875. 
Remarks: Documented in the 13th century. Popular in literary and oral versions  
since the 15th century, and as a modern legend in the 20th century.

|1538      The Revenge of the Cheated Man (previously The Youth Cheated in Selling Oxen). A youth (farmer, fool) goes to the market to sell cattle (fowl, eggs). On the way he meets a trickster (monk, robber, land lord, judge) who convinces him that his cattle are not worth very much. He sells (is compelled to sell) them for a very low price [K132]. Cf. Type 1551. The youth resolves to revenge himself on the trickster. He dis- guises himself as a beggar-woman (bride, carpenter, woodcutter, builder) and tricks him so that the trickster lets himself be tied to a tree [K713.1] and the youth is able to beat him. The trickster goes to get medical help. The youth disguises himself as a doctor and beats him again (in a monastery, bathhouse, robbers’ den) [K1825.1.3]. In the end the youth takes his cattle back and also gets some money. In some variants, instead of one trickster, the youth takes re venge on many (seven, twelve, forty).

|1538*     The Jester as Bride. A witty fellow (trickster) dresses himself in his sister’s clothes and works as a servant girl (employee) to a clergy man (master). The son of a rich man (mayor) chooses him as his bride and prefers him to the priest’s daughters, because only he is able to pass a test of feminity (is the cleverest of the girls). On the wedding night a rope is tied to the “bride”s’ leg. He frees himself, ties a goat (ram) to the end of the rope, and goes away. Then he returns wearing his own clothes and demands compensation for his sister’s having been turned into a goat. In some variants the bridegroom discovers that his bride is a man and leaves town. The groom’s parents bribe the “servant girl” not to tell what happened. Cf. Type 1542.

|1539      Cleverness and Gullibility. Three students (butchers, rascals) con- vince a farmer (fool, trickster) that his cow (donkey, mule, ox) is a goat (hen, donkey), so he sells the animal cheaply [K132]. (In vari ants from southern and eastern Europe, the farmer is persuaded to cut off the animal’s horns, ears, and tail in order to get a better price.) The farmer pays in advance at three inns and invites the students to eat with him. Instead of paying, he turns his hat around three times  (hits it on the table, throws it on the floor, rings a bell), and the innkeeper says that the bill has been settled. The students buy the hat for a high price. When they try to use it, they discover the trick [K111.2]. (Variants from central Europe end here.) When the students come back for revenge, the farmer pretends to be dead. His wife (occasionally the students) revives him with a stick [K113.4]. (Or, the farmer ties a skin filled with blood under his wife’s clothes and pretends to kill her.) He revives her with a “magic wand” (flute, violin, knife), which he sells to the students. The students kill their wives (mothers) but cannot revive them. They put the farmer into a sack (cask) to be drowned, but he trades places with a herdsman who comes by. By pretending to have found the herd of cattle on the bottom of the sea, the farmer induces his greedy adversaries to jump into the water. Cf. Type 1535. In variants from southern and eastern Europe, after the intro- duction in which the animal is mutilated, the farmer puts coins in the anus of his donkey (horse, cow) or mixes them with its dung. He sells the animal as a gold-producer [K111.1] (and says that the ani- mal must remain in its stall for two weeks or forty days. The animal dies.). In some versions, the farmer sells his adversaries supposedly wonderful objects, e.g. a messenger rabbit [K131.1], a pot that cooks by itself [K112.1], a pick that locates gold, a rifle that always hits its mark, or a self-propelled sled. Or the farmer promises to teach them to speak Latin and cuts their tongues off [K1068.2]. Some variants end with the farmer buried alive. When his adver- saries come to rob the grave, he brands them [K911.1] or cuts off their genitals (noses).

1539A*   Closing Up the Wine Cask. A master (landlord) makes up a pretext to send a boy (a farmer) who has offended him to the wine cellar, where the servant is supposed to give him a beating. When the boy sees the servant, he pulls the bung out of the wine cask so that the servant has to use his thumb to close it up. The boy beats him up and runs away, taking bacon (sausage), bread, and a jug of wine with him. Cf. Type 921D*. In some variants, a guest tries to cheat an innkeeper (leaves with- out paying his bill) who has boasted to him that such a thing had never happened to her. He tells her that he can draw both red and white (any kind of) wine from the same cask. He bores two holes in one cask and tells her to stop them with her thumbs while he goes upstairs to get a glass (some glasses). He leaves and does not come back, so the innkeeper has to wait until her husband comes to rescue her.

|1540      The Student from Paradise (Paris). A student (beggar, traveler, clergy- man) tells a (foolish) woman that he comes from Paris. She under- stands this to be Paradise. (Or, he sings, “I come from heaven”, or says he comes from the beyond or is a messenger from hell). The wife tells him that her husband (son) died shortly before. The stu- dent claims to have met him in paradise (hell) and tells her that her husband needs certain things. The wife gives the student money (clothes, food, horse, etc.) to take to her husband [J2326]. The oldest son (brother-in-law, husband) goes after the trickster to retrieve the money. The trickster steals his horse (the son runs his own horse to death) [K341.9.1]. Cf. Type 1540A*.

|1541      For the Long Winter. A man (farmer) has accumulated a store of pro visions (saved some money, good clothing, or a sausage). His stupid wife reproaches him with this, and he says that it is for the long winter (spring, emergencies, a good day). Later, when he is away, a trickster (beggar) comes to the woman  and says (in answer to her question) that he is the long winter. (He greets her with “Good day”, and she thinks that is his name.) The wife gives him the provisions [K362.1, J2460.1]. Cf. Types 1385*, 1463A*, and 1700.

|1542       The Clever Boy. (Including the previous Type 1542A.) The king chal- lenges the trickster Peik (Eulenspiegel, Abū Nuwās, Aldar Iwan, Nasreddin Hodja, Toba, etc.) to play a trick on him. Peik borrows the king’s horse to go home and get his fooling sticks (book of lies, trickster’s secrets). Instead of coming back, he sells the horse [K341.8.1]. (Previously Type 1542A.) Cf. Type 1525B. When next he meets the king, Peik sells the king a cooking pot that is supposed to cook without fire [K112.1]. Later, Peik pretends to stab his sister, who has hidden a blood-filled bladder under her clothes. He “revives” her with a supposedly-magic flute, which he sells to the king [K113]. Cf. Type 1539. The king kills one of his daughters but cannot revive her with the flute [J2401]. Peik wears his sister’s clothes and is engaged as a lady-in-waiting in the king’s court. A prince wants to marry him, but Peik flees on the wedding night. (He is found to be responsible for the preg nancy of the princess [K1321.1].) Cf. Type 1538*. Peik is sentenced to death and is to be drowned in a sack (cask). He tricks someone else into taking his place [K842]. The king for gives Peik and makes him his son-in-law [L161]. Cf. Types 1535, 1539. 

Combinations: 1530, 1535, and 1539. 
Remarks: This episodic humorous tale is composed of various popular, interchangeable scenes, and therefore the tale does not have well-defined limits. The  
tale is often associated with a popular, named trickster. The episode of the stolen  
horse also exists independently.

|1543     Not One Penny Less. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A poor man (soldier, youth) prays to a saint’s picture for a certain amount of money, promising to give back double that amount at the end of a month. The sexton overhears and, hoping for the large repayment, gives the poor man what he asked for. The sexton claims to be the messenger of the saint, but the poor man refuses to repay the money to him [K464]. (2) A poor man (journeyman, farmhand, sexton, trickster) asks God (a saint) for a certain sum of money, no more and no less. A rich man (master, gentleman, priest, Jew) tests him by giving him (as a joke) 99 (999) instead of 100 (1000) (gold) coins. The poor man ac cepts them, saying, “Whoever gave me these will surely give me the last one too”, (he counts the value of the purse as the missing coin, adds a coin of his own). He refuses to pay back the money and makes blasphemous excuses (God is old and forgetful, or He cannot count) [J1473.1]. Often the tale continues: The lender goes to a judge in order to force the poor man to repay his money. Before the case is tried, the poor man tricks the lender out of his overcoat, shoes, and often his horse. Even the judge is tricked by the poor man, who makes the lender so suspicious that the judge thinks he must be insane. (Cf. Types 1525L, 1642A.) On his way home, the poor man meets someone who says he is the Son of God. The poor man demands that he give him the missing coin which his father had overlooked.

|1543A     The Greedy Dreamer. A man dreams that he has nine coins (bills). He demands ten (he wants to change the bills into gold). He wakes up and realizes that he had been dreaming. He regrets that he did not accept the nine coins (the bills) [J1473]. In Arabic variants the greedy man dreams that he is trying to sell his sheep (hogs) for eight dirhams (100 denari) each. A customer offers to pay him half of that. When he wakes up and sees no money, he closes his eyes and says, “At least give me four”.

|1543*     The Man without a Member. (Including the previous Type 1543A*.) A father (farmer) has a marriageable daughter who is ignorant about (afraid of) sex. He finds a husband for her who claims to have no penis. This man sleeps with her and entertains her with his “curry- comb” (“comb” or some other word for his penis) so successfully that she becomes too demanding for him. He tells her that he does not have his curry-comb any more (he had only borrowed it and had to give it back, etc.). She gives him money (he borrows it from her) to go to the market and buy a new one [J1919.8]. After he leaves her (is sent away by her father because she be came pregnant), she goes after him and asks him to leave her his curry- comb. He pretends to cut off his penis, but instead puts a stone in water and says that that is his comb. She asks a passer-by (monk, her father) to get it out of the water. When the passer-by takes off his clothes, she discovers “her” curry-comb hanging between his legs and grabs hold of it (tears it off).

1543C*   The Clever Doctor. A man complains to a doctor that he has no sense of taste, can never tell the truth, and has a bad memory. The doctor treats him with three capsules filled with feces (puts dung in his mouth). The first restores his sense of taste, after the second, he is able to speak the truth, and when he takes the third, he proves that his memory is good. In some variants, a clever doctor heals a patient by diverting his attention. For example, in a Jewish variant a king has an inflamed eye because he touches it all the time. The doctor tells him that he is pregnant and will give birth in nine months. The king begins to worry about his stomach and touches it: Thus his eye is able to heal. When the birth does not take place, the doctor explains his trick and is made court physician.

|1543E*    Tree as Witness. Two friends with names that describe their charac- ters (e.g. stupid, clever) become rich (find a treasure) in a foreign country. They decide to bury the money under a tree in order to share it later. The clever one steals the money, accuses the stupid one of theft and brings him to trial. He names the tree(spirit) as witness. The next day the judge intends to interview the tree. The clever one asks his father to hide in the hollow of the tree and to tell the judge that the stupid one has stolen the money. The aston- ished judge (the clever one) orders the tree to be burned [K1971.12]. The father screams, and his son is exposed and punished. The stupid one is given all the money [K451.3].

|1544      The Man Who Got a Night’s Lodging. (Including the previous Type 1543B*.) A rascal (trickster) pretends to be deaf and takes a house- holder’s greeting as an invitation to sit at the table and help himself to the best food [K1981.1]. (He ignores the householder’s hints and eats well; previously Type 1543B*.) He trades the householder’s horse for his own, and when he is asked to pay for his food with a goatskin, he kills one of the house- holder’s goats [K258]. At night he sleeps with the wife and/or daughter. When the wife bakes pancakes for her hungry husband, the guest sneaks them him- self. He informs the husband about his sexual relations with the wife (daughter) [K1572]. The husband becomes angry and goes to kill the guest’s horse, but kills his own instead [K942]. Every time, the guest gets the better of the householder.

The woman does not understand and lets him leave with the goose.

|1545      The Boy with Many Names. A man is employed as a farmhand by a master (king, rich man, clergyman), but refuses to use his right name. Various people call him absurd names, for example, Bird, Hair, Sultry (I Myself, Cat, Cramp) [K602]. The different names cause misunderstandings that work to the farmhand’s advantage: He sleeps with the daughter and wife of his master. When they accuse him, the master does not understand them, and the farmhand continues this behavior. The master knows that the servant has stolen money (other valuables), but because of his peculiar names he is not convicted of the theft. After the farm hand leaves, his tricks are discovered, but he is not apprehended because the people who seek him are ridiculed for calling out his names.

|1545B     The Boy Who Knew Nothing of Women. A rich clergyman (farmer) wants a farmhand who will not seduce his daughter(s), and asks applicants about the genitals of a horse (other animal), the proce dure of copulation, or the difference between men and women. The boys who know the right answers are not hired. After a time, a youth in disguise comes again pretending that he cannot answer the question(s), and the clergyman hires him. The clergyman calls the wife’s and daughter’s vaginas prisons, and the youth pretends to be innocent and not to know what they are for. Through other tricks (e.g. using ambiguous names; cf. Type 1545), he seduces the sexually-naive wife and daughter in the presence of the clergyman [K1327]. For example, in a Russian variant, one night the farmhand tells his employer that he has caught a thief (which is his penis) who should be sent to prison. In the presence of the unsuspecting clergy man, he sends the “thief” into the prisons of the wife and daughter. When he realizes what has happened, the clergyman gets angry and curses the farmhand, thus losing an expensive wager (cf. Type 1000), and has to let him go free.

When the trickster is supposed to produce the lump of gold, he makes an excuse: He had only asked the question so he would know what to expect if he ever found such a lump. He leaves town with the money (thanks the goldsmith for the meal) [K261, K476.2].

|1547*     The Trickster with Painted Penis. A soldier (student) lodges with a farmer (innkeeper). He wants to seduce the housewife (and the daughter) but can never find her alone. He paints three colored rings on his penis and lets it hang out of his clothes (at night, or as if by accident). The wife is curious and asks him why his penis is so dif- fer ent from her husband’s. He tells her that, depending on which rings go in, he can beget a soldier, officer, or general (minister, dean, or bishop). The couple ask him to beget an officer and pay him for his ser- vices. While the soldier and the wife are having intercourse, the farmer gives the soldier a push from behind, so that, for the same price, the wife should get a general instead of an officer [K1398]. Cf. Type 1855A. In some variants the farmer, who is unable to impregnate his wife, initiates the bargain.

The soldier offers to show her how to make soup from a stone (nail, ax, horseshoe) (sometimes without the introduc- tory situation). She agrees. While the stone “cooks”, she brings him all that he asks for, one after another: flour, grease, meat (bacon), vege tables, etc. After they eat the soup, the soldier says he is too full to eat the stone (he sells the wonderful stone to the woman) [K112.2].

|1551      The Wager That Sheep are Hogs. A farmer (poor man) drives his sheep (cow, horse) to market. A trickster (soldier, student) who would like to buy the sheep cheaply tries to convince the farmer that they are piglets (goats, donkeys). The farmer insists that they are sheep. An accomplice of the trickster arrives and offers to settle the dispute: he proclaims that the animals are pigs. Another passer-by, also an accomplice, agrees. The farmer sells his sheep for the price of pigs [K451.2]. Cf. Type 1538. In some variants, five tricksters one after the other convince a farm er, who is taking his lamb to market, that it is a dog. The farmer throws the animal away, and the five men get roast lamb for free.

He bets with the owner that some- thing that he wants is not for sale in the store, and the owner accepts the bet. The customer asks for something unusual (e.g. sunglasses for his cow) and wins the bet. The owner sends the customer to another store and warns the storekeeper there. The customer makes the same bet. This time he asks for something different (e.g. shoes for his rooster) and wins again. (Sometimes there is a third episode with higher stakes, which the farmer wins again.)

|1561      Three Meals in a Row (previously The Lazy Boy Eats Breakfast, Din- ner, and Supper One after the Other). A foolish farmhand (servant) refuses to work while he is hungry. He eats all three meals of the day one after another, and then goes to sleep [W111.2.6]. In some variants, a farmer (master, clergyman) insists that his farmhand eat all three meals one after the other so that he will not eat so much (not spend so much time eating). The clever farmhand goes to bed right after “supper”.

|1561*    A Cure for Nearsightedness (previously The Boy “Loses his Sight”). A farmhand complains to his master (farmer, skipper, shoemaker) that he must be growing nearsighted (blind), because he cannot see the filling in his sandwich [J1561.4.2]. (He asks for glasses to see what has been given to him to eat.) The wife of his master takes the complaint to heart and gives him more cheese on his bread for his next meal. The farmhand says this is much better, because now he can read the newspaper through the cheese.

|1562A     “The Barn is Burning!” A master has instructed his farmhand (a trav- eler) to use peculiar names for everything, for example, Purity for the cat, Beauty for the fire, High for the roof (and punishes the farmhand when he does not). The farmhand plans revenge and ties a bundle of straw, which he lights, to the cat’s tail. When the burning cat sets the barn roof on fire, the farmhand uses the special words to tell his master. The fire burns out of control before the master understands the complicated message [J1269.12]. Cf. Type 1940.

|1562B     Wife Follows Written Instructions. A master (husband) writes a list of instructions for his apprentice (servant, wife) (the apprentice asks for such a list). One day when they are traveling together, the (drunk  en) master falls into the mud (ditch, stream) and asks the ap prentice to rescue him. The apprentice answers that he does not know whether this is part of his duties and runs home to look up the situation in his instructions. (The master manages to get himself out, and tears up the list.) [J2516.3.1].

|1563      “Both?” A farmhand (often an ill-treated one) is sent by the farmer into the house to get something. He tells the wife that he has been ordered to sleep with her and/or her daughter(s). They are shocked and call out to the farmer something like, “Shall we give it to him?” – “Both?” – “All three?” The farmer says yes, and they go to bed with the farmhand [K1354.1, cf. K1354.2.1]. In northern Italian variants, the trickster is a wild man (giant, magician), and instead of sex he takes money or gold. In variants from the Caucasus and middle to western Asia, the trickster wants to take the daughters away and marry them.

|1563*     The Terrible Threat (previously Sham Threat: either... or). This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A man’s horse (saddle, bridle, etc.) is stolen. He threatens that if it is not returned immediately, he will do what his father would have done in these circumstances. The bystanders are horrified and give him a new horse (the thief returns his horse). They ask the man what it was his father would have done. He replies, “He would have walked” (have bought a new saddle). In oriental variants, the man’s shoes are stolen, and the man says his father would have bought new shoes. (2) Two travelers (horsemen, teamsters) meet on the road and neither will give way to the other. One of them threatens that if the other does not let him pass, he will do to him what he did the day before to another man who was in his way. The other traveler lets him pass, and asks what it was he had done the day before. He re- plies that he had let the man pass [K1771.2]. Cf. Type 202. (3) A beggar (dervish, Gypsy) threatens the inhabitants of a village (a single person) that if they do not give him some particular thing, he will do to them what he did to the people in another village (what his father did in the same situation, something he does not want to have to do). They give him what he wants but ask what he meant by his threat. He explains, he had to go on without the thing (had to work). (4) A lazy student (night watchman) asks his father for money (asks for more pay). He threatens that if his request is not granted, he will have to do something that he does not want to have to do. The answer to the question is, he will have to study (work for his same wages) [K1771.3]. 

Remarks: Version (1) is documented in the 8th century in the Carmina of Theodulf of Orléans. Version (2) appears in the early 17th century in Otho Melander’s  
Jocorum atque seriorum [...] Liber primus. Version (3) appears in the 14th century  
in the Persian Resāle-ye delgošā of ʿObeidallāh Zākāni. Version (4) is part of the  
Nasreddin Hodja tradition.

|1564*     The Clever Granary Watcher. (Including the previous Type 1564**.) A man who is supposed to guard a certain farmer’s granary steals the grain. The wagon he uses to carry the grain falls into a ditch. When the farmer comes by, the thief tells him that the grain belongs to himself. The farmer orders his other farmhands to help the thief [K405.1]. In some variants, the thieving guard says he is bringing the grain to the owner’s barn. The farmer realizes that it is his own grain [K439.2]. (Previously Type 1564**.)

|1565      Agreement Not to Scratch. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A man (trickster) continually scratches his head or body (be- cause of a disease) (he sneezes continually). He is promised a reward if he can refrain from scratching (sneezing) for a certain length of time. When he can no longer resist the itching, he tells a story (calls out) in which he can make gestures or sounds that permit him to scratch (sneeze) [K263]. Sometimes the listeners realize what he has done, but they reward him anyway because they admire his clever- ness. (2) A bald (mangy) man (with head lice), a man who scratches him self, and a man with a dripping nose agree (are ordered, often by the king) not to touch themselves. All of them manage to break the pro hibition by telling stories which they illustrate with their for- bidden movements. For example, the bald man says that his father bought him a fur cap, and he mimics putting it on and taking it off. The scratching man says his father bought him clothes, and touches himself to show where they did not fit. The man with the dripping nose calls them both liars and points at them by rubbing his nose twice with his fingers. (3) A god offers a prize (his daughter, an ox, both) to whichever animal can clear a field of nettles without scratching himself. After other animals try and fail, a certain animal (spider, Brer Rabbit) wins the prize by disguising his scratching in his animated description of the ox. (4) Two men (a Jew and a Russian) agree not to scratch. Each tries to make the other break the agreement. For example, the Jew sprinkles pepper in the Russian’s shirt, and the Russian puts lice in the Jew’s trousers. When the Russian can resist no longer, he says that his uncle received medals from the czar, which he wore “here and here and here”, thus scratching those places. The Jew replies that his uncle received so many medals that he had to put them in his trousers’ pocket and feel around for them – which he demon- strates.

Remarks: This tale originates in medieval Arabian literature. The oral tradition  
is widespread and variable. Version (3), the most stable form, has African and  
African-American subtypes.

|1565*     The Big Cake. During Lent, the farmers are not allowed to eat more than a single cake. They bake a cake as big as a cart wheel [K2311]. In some variants they may eat only one spoonful of porridge, so they make a huge spoon. In a Jewish version (Sephardic), a man has to abstain from alco- hol for health reasons. However, he is allowed a glass of wine on the Sabbath. He has a big glass made that holds an entire bottle of wine.

A stingy master gives his farm- hand bread crusts to eat. The farmhand claims that he would get full more quickly on soft bread, so the master gives him both [J1341.1]. (Previously Type 1567B.) In a Spanish version, a landlady serves a tailor only one egg, and he sings a little song about it. For his next meal she gives him two eggs. He composes other songs to compel her to give him more eggs and a sausage, etc., as well [J1341.4]. (Previously Type 1567D.) A master gives his farmhands no butter to eat, intending to sell it instead. The farmhands make a fish into a model of a “butter-dealer”. Their master asks what it is, and when they explain, he re lents and gives them their butter. (Previously Type 1567*.)

The guest holds a small fish up to his ear. The host asks why, and the guest replies that he had asked the fish where his recently-drowned father (Jonas and the whale) is. The fish answered that he is too young to know such a thing, but the guest should ask the older fish (under the bed) [J1341.2]. In some variants, a stinking fish should have said he does not know what happened recently in the sea because he was caught eight days ago. Everyone laughs, and the guest is served a bigger (fresher) fish.

|1568*     The Master and the Farmhand at the Table. A farmer and his farm- hands help themselves to food out of a common dish. The farmwife always places the dish so that the best piece of meat lies near the farmer. Once the farmhand comes to the table early. No one is in the room, so he moves the dish to put the best serving near his own place. The farmer sees what he did, picks up the dish saying, “This dish once costed one thaler”, and moves it back to its customary posi tion. Before he can stab the meat, the farmhand picks up the dish, says, “And it is still worth that today”, and moves the dish back near his own place. In some variants the farmer (clergyman) gets the best pieces (e.g. cracklings, butter) from the common dish by asking the other diners whether they know which way the sun (moon) rotates. He rotates the dish right or left to move the best part near himself. When the dish is in place, the farmhand says, “And then the thunderstorm begins”, stabbing his fist into the dish (stabbing the dish on the farmer’s head) [Cf. J1562.1].

|1568**    The Master and the Pupil Quarrel. A stingy tailor sticks all the bits of meat together. When the meal is served, he takes the first helping, and all the meat lands on his plate. He announces, “What God has joined together, let no man put asunder”. The hungry apprentices plan revenge. They tell a customer that their master does good work but his temper is unpredictable: he often strikes the table with his fist and then falls in a rage. Before the tailor cuts the cloth, he hits the table to make the shears bounce so he can hear where they are and find them. The customer thinks the tailor is going to attack him and defends himself by grabbing the tailor around the neck and fighting. The tailor calls his apprentices to help, but they answer, “What God has joined together, let no man put asunder”.

|1572*     The Master’s Privilege. A farmer asks his farmhand if he has any per sonal defects, and the farmhand replies that he sometimes gets into a rage (other description). The farmer says that his own defect is that he sometimes gets into a frenzy (etc.). The first time the farmhand man gets into a rage, he stays in bed (leaves his work), so the farmer gets into a frenzy and beats him. This cures the farmhand’s rage, and the master no longer gets into a frenzy either [J1511.4].

1572A*   The Saints Ate the Cream. (Including the previous Type 1829A*.) A clergyman sets a jug of sour cream (cream, milk, ham, honey) near a saint’s picture (in the pantry). When he is gone, the sexton (farm- hand) steals (empties) it, smearing a little cream on the saint’s pic ture (statues). The clergyman believes that the icon stole the cream. He insults it and removes it from the church (the sexton hides it secretly, and the clergyman thinks it has run away; cf. Type 1826A*). On the next holy day (the saint’s feast day), the clergyman asks the sexton (offers to pay him) to get a new icon. The sexton polishes the old icon and pretends that the saint has returned. The clergyman promises always to give the icon good food. The sexton thus eats well in the future.

|1574      The Tailor’s Dream. For many years, a tailor has stolen cloth from his customers. He dreams that on Judgment Day he has to answer to God by making a flag out of all the pieces of stolen cloth. After this dream, he swears not to steal any more, and asks one of his em- ployees to remind him of the dream if he ever lapses. For a long time, the tailor steals nothing. One day he is given some particularly fine material and plans to steal it. When the employee reminds him of his resolution, the tailor replies that this particular piece of material was not part of the flag [J1401].

|1574A     The Stolen Piece of Cloth (previously The Oversight of the Thievish Tailor). (Including the previous Types 1574B and 1574C.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) By mistake, a tailor sews a piece of cloth he has stolen on the outside of his coat, rather than on the inside. (2) A tailor takes advantage of an opportunity to cut a big piece of cloth. Then he realizes that he cut it out of his own coat [X221.1]. Or, the tailor, who regularly takes part of his customers’ cloth for himself, cuts out some cloth for himself and lays a piece aside. When his wife asks what he is doing, he replies he did not want to get out of practice. (Previously Type 1574B.) (3) A stingy woman has the tailor come to her own house so that he will not be able to steal her cloth. The tailor cuts a piece and throws it out of the window, saying, “That is the devil’s piece”. While the woman runs outside to retrieve it, the tailor cuts another big piece of cloth for himself [K341.13]. (Previously Type 1574C.)

|1577**    The Blind Man Tricked. A boy who works as a guide and servant to a stingy blind man is so hungry that he steals a sausage (pie) from him. The blind man smells that the boy has eaten the food and beats him. The boy takes revenge by pretending to help the blind man cross a pit. He leads the man near a post (tree), runs a few steps, and pretends to jump over the pit. The blind man copies him and jumps into the post. He falls and is injured. The boy comments, “If he could smell that I ate the sausage, he should have smelled that there was a post there”. Cf. Type 1577.

|1579      Carrying Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage across Stream. A man has to cross a stream in a boat that will hold himself and only one other object. He needs to transport a wolf (lion, jackal), a goat (sheep), and a cabbage (bundle of hay, pumpkin). He must be sure that, when he is out in the boat, the wolf does not eat the goat and the goat does not eat the cabbage. There are two solutions. (1) He takes the goat across, then takes wolf across and brings goat back; he takes cabbage across, comes back, and takes the goat across last. (2) He takes the goat over, then takes the cabbage over and brings the goat back; he takes wolf over, and then takes goat over last [H506.3].

|1586      The Man in Court for Killing a Fly. (Including the previous Types 163A*, 1433*, and 1586A.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man (farmer, baker, fool) goes to court, accusing flies of stealing (previously Type 1433*). The judge (mayor, czar) decrees that the man may kill whatever flies he can. A fly lands on the judge’s nose (cheek), and the complainant carries out the sentence. The judge  is injured or killed, but no one can accuse the foolish fly-killer [J1193.1]. (2) A fool (several fools) tries to kill (shoo away) a fly (several flies, bees, etc.) with an unsuitable instrument (ax, cannon, sword, gun, etc.). He accidentally kills the person whom the insect had been bothering [J1833, J1833.1]. (Previously Type 1586A.) Cf. Type 248. In some variants the killer is an (tame) animal (e.g. bear, monkey) [N333.2]. (Previously Type 163A*.) 

Combinations: This type is usually combined with one or more other types, esp.  
1319*, 1341, 1642, 1643, and 1681B. 
Remarks: Version (2) is found in ancient classical (Phaedrus/Perry 1965, V,3) and  
Indian (Makasa-jātaka, Rohiṇi-jātaka) sources. It was popularized in Europe in the  
15th–16th centuries through Girolamo Morlini’s novella (No. 21).

|1588**    Cheater Caught by Seizing on His Own Words. A father warns his sons against red-haired and red-faced men. They stay with a red- haired innkeeper. They like his food so much that they tell him each spoonful is worth ten francs. The innkeeper secretly counts how many spoonfuls they eat. When they go to pay, he demands a great amount of money. Further on, the sons meet a red-faced man and are about to flee. He stops them and asks why, so they tell him about their father ’s warning and the innkeeper’s trickery. The red-faced man goes back with them to the inn. The innkeeper is about to slaughter an animal, and the red-faced man contracts to buy a quarter (the shoulder). He draws his sword as if he would slaughter the innkeeper and take a quarter of his body [K2310]. The innkeeper redeems himself for as much money as the sons had paid for their food. The red-faced man gives them the money.

|1590      The Tresspasser’s Defense. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Two men fight over a piece of land that each claims is his own. The case comes to court. The false owner (one or more wit nesses) swears a false oath [K475]: The perjurer takes earth from his own prop erty and puts it in his shoes (a ladle or comb under his hat). He goes to the property (before the judge) and swears that he is standing on his own ground, or calls on the creator (the ladle, German Schöp- fer ) or the judge (the comb, German dialect Richter) as witness [K2310, M105]. The case is decided in favor of the trickster (he is punished through an ordeal or by human or supernatural forces immediately or after death [Q270, Q272]). The tale concludes with an explanation of local property ownership (a warning against false testimony). (2) Through laziness (criminal activities, etc.), a man (Eulen- spiegel) falls out of the favor of his king (master). As punishment (to get rid of him), he is banished. The man comes back in a cart with foreign soil (foreign dirt in his shoes) and thus cleverly avoids his punishment [J1161.3]. He is reconciled with the king (is banished again; is captured and subjected to a fake execution, and dies of fright). 

Combinations: 922, 1535. 
Remarks: The oldest known form of version (1) is found in a short, 12th-century  
account of the life of St. Egwinus (died 717). Version (2) is documented in the late  
14th century (Sacchetti, No. 27) and has since been attached to many well-known  
tricksters.

|1591       The Three Joint Depositors. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Two men leave money with a woman and instruct her to re turn it only when both of them demand it. Later, one asks for the money and explains that the other has since died. The woman gives it to him. The second man comes and demands the money. The woman will not give it to him so he takes her to court. Her lawyer (Demosthenes) advises her: She should tell the judge about the agreement and offer to pay out the money only when both of the men come and demand it. The case is dismissed. (2) Three men leave money with a banker, with the same instruc- tions as in version (1). One of the three arranges with the others to withdraw some of the money. He tells his companions he will take only a small amount, but he takes the entire sum from the banker. The banker asks the two others, who agree, thinking it is only a small sum. The cheater leaves, and the tale ends as in version (1), following the instructions of a clever adviser [J1161.1]. 

Remarks: Version (1) was first recorded by Valerius Maximus, Facta et dicta memorabilia (VII,3, ext. 5). Version (2) comes from Angelo Poliziano (No. 215).

|1592      The Iron-Eating Mice. A merchant going on a journey leaves some iron (iron object, lead, gold) in trust with someone (another mer chant, innkeeper, friend, Jew). When he comes back later for his prop erty, the trustee claims that mice (rats) have eaten it. The merchant kid- naps the son of the trustee and claims that a falcon (other raptor) carried him off. The judge decides that the two men should make an exchange [J1531.2]. In a Middle Eastern version, the cheated man calls on a trickster (Nasreddin Hodja, Bohlul) for help. This helper threatens to destroy (burn) the house in order to punish the thieving mice. The trustee relents. 

Remarks: Documented in Indian literature (Tantrākhyāyika, Jātakas, Kathāsaritsāgara). Popularized in Europe through Arabic translations from the Pañcatantra  
(Kalila and Dimna). The motif of the iron-eating mice can already be found in the  
antique literature: Pliny, Naturalis historia (VIII,221f.).

|1592A     The Transformed Gold (previously The Transformed Golden Pump- kin). A merchant (carpenter, pilgrim) gives his neighbor (friend, cadi, Jew) (a vessel of) gold to keep for him. When the merchant later asks for it back, the trustee gives him (a similar vessel of) copper (brass, tallow) and claims that the gold changed to base metal. The merchant kidnaps the son (children) of the false trustee. He trains an animal (monkey, bear) so that it welcomes the trustee and claims that the boy turned into the animal. The trustee relents [J1531.1].

|1613      Playing Cards are My Calendar and Prayer Book. (Including the pre  - vi ous Type 2340.) A soldier (servant) is caught playing cards dur ing church. His sergeant demands that he put the cards away, but the soldier refuses. When the soldier is brought to the major for punishment, he ex- plains that each card has a spiritual significance: the ace is God the Father, the deuce is the dual nature of Christ, the three is the Holy Trinity, the four is the four evangelists, the five is the wounds of Christ, etc., up to ten. Then come the face cards: the four queens are the Virgin Mary and the three women at the Holy Sepulchur, the four kings show the three wise men and the greatest among them whom they came to worship, etc. Then the soldier explains that the deck of cards is also a calendar, with 365 spots, 52 pages and 12 pictures. He lays the jack of clubs aside, saying that this card is not respectable. The major asks what it represents, and the soldier replies that it is the sergeant who ac cused him of blasphemy. The major rewards the solider with money (and punishes him in addition) [H603]. Cf. Types1827A, 1839B.

1613A§. 
1613A*  Political Convictions. In the 18th century a man is brought before a group of men and asked if he is a monarchist or a republican. He answers, “A republican”, and is beaten because the group of men are monarchists. Some time later, he is questioned again. Now he answers, “Mon- ar chist”. This time the group is republican, so the man is beat en again. The third time this happens, the man answers, “I belong to the devil!” This time no one beats him.

|1617      Unjust Banker Deceived into Delivering Deposits. A man (woman) goes on a journey (pilgrimage) and/or gives his money (jewels, other valuables) to an acquaintance (official, religious person, judge) to keep on his behalf. When he asks for his money back, the ac quaint- ance lies and says that he has nothing of that man’s. A friend (wife, ruler) helps the man get his money back by making the cheater be- lieve that if he returns it, he will be given even more [K455.9, K476.2, K1667]. In addition to this European form, this type exhibits considerable variation.

|1617*     The Blind Man’s Treasure. A (blind) man buries a treasure, but is ob served by another man (neighbor). Or the blind man tells his god father where the treasure is hidden. The money is stolen. The blind man tricks the suspect by telling him that he had planned to put the same amount (an even greater sum) of money in the same place . The thief brings the stolen money back in the hope that he can steal double the amount. In the end he gets nothing [J1141.6, K421.1, K1667.1, K1667.1.1, K1667.1.2].

|1620      The Emperor’s New Clothes. This type exists chiefly in two different versions: (1) A trickster pretends to be a painter and is hired to decorate the walls in the house of a wealthy man. While he works (along with his assistants), his employer pays his expenses (and gives him an ad- vance payment). The trickster paints nothing, but he claims that his paintings can be seen only by persons of noble birth (chaste women). Everyone praises the paintings rather than risk being accused. A fool (foolish woman, soldier) says that he would rather be a bastard, but that he does not see any pictures. (2) A man (two, more) pretends that he can weave fine cloth (cloth- ing, coat, cap), and is employed by a ruler. When the weaver is asked how his work is progressing, he explains that the clothing can be seen only by people of noble birth (chaste women). The ruler comes to be fitted. Neither he nor his courtiers will admit that they can see no clothing. When the ruler goes outside naked, only a child speaks the truth [J2312, K445]. Cf. Types 987, 1406.

|1620*      The Conversation of Two Handicapped Persons (previously The Con- ver sation of the One-eyed Man and the Hunchback). This tale exists chiefly in three different versions: (1) A one-eyed man tells a hunchbacked man that he took up his burden too soon. “No, it is not too soon” answers the hunchbacked man, “it only looks so to you because you have only one of your windows open”. (2) A young woman jokes with a hunchbacked man, saying that he has too much back. He answers, “Be careful that you don’t end up with too much belly”. (3) A short man tells a one-eyed man that he needs another eye. The one-eyed man answers, “To see a giant such as yourself, I would need two more eyes”.

Cf. Type 1807A. (2) A thief (soldier, Gypsy) goes into a house to steal bacon (suit). When the owner hears a noise, he comes and finds the thief with the bacon. The thief asks him if he would like to buy some.

|1626      Dream Bread. Traveling companions (pilgrims, friends, brothers, master and servant, clergyman and Gypsy) agree that whichever of them has the most wonderful dream may eat their last loaf of bread. One man stays awake and eats the bread. The next morning, the others tell their dreams: one dreamed that he was in heaven (paradise) and another that he was in hell. The third man says he saw them there in his dream (he had dreamed they were dead), and he ate the bread because he thought they would not need it (would not be coming back) [K444].

|1631A     Mule Painted and Sold Back to Owner. A donkey (mule, horse, cow, goat) is stolen or sold. The new owner (thief, dealer, farmer, Gypsy, servant) paints it (makes it look young and fresh) and sells it at a big profit to its original owner (master, priest, charcoal dealer, farmer), who likes it because of its similarity to his old animal. (Even though he had been warned, he does not notice the trick.) After the buyer takes the animal home, the paint washes off in the rain (river, wash water) and the owner recognizes his old animal [K134.3].

In revenge, the smith tells the woman that the tailor is insane. He puts a red-hot piece of iron in the tailor’s boot. When the tailor puts the boot on, he falls down with pain and cries, “It is burning!” Every one agrees that he must be insane. The woman marries the smith (no one) [T92.12.1].

|1640      The Brave Tailor. (Seven with one stroke.) A tailor kills seven flies with one blow and wears a sign on his belt, “Seven at one stroke”. [J115.4, K1951.1]. He goes out into the world and finds something (cheese, bird) which he puts into his pocket. He meets a giant who challenges him to prove his strength. The giant squeezes water out of a stone, and the tailor matches him by squeezing his cheese [K62] (cf. Type 1060). The giant throws a stone high into the air and the tailor throws his bird [K18.3] (cf. Type 1062). The giant orders the tailor to help him carry a tree out of the forest, so the tailor takes the top end and rides in the branches [K71] (cf. Type 1052). Using various tricks, he accomplishes other feats ([K1112] cf. Type 1051; [K63] cf. Type 1061; [K18.2] cf. Type 1063; [K72] cf. Type 1082; [K61] cf. Type 1085; [K525.1] cf. Type 1115). The tailor goes to the king’s palace. The king promises the tailor his daughter in marriage and half the kingdom if he can accomplish several tasks: vanquishing two giants [K1082], catching a unicorn (the animal runs into a tree with its horn, and cannot get free) [K771], and catching a wild boar (he drives it into a church) [K731]. The tailor uses tricks to accomplish the tasks. After the tailor marries the princess, he accidentally (by speaking of needle and thread, or in his sleep) discloses his humble origin [H38.2.1]. The king sends his soldiers to take back the tailor’s king- dom. The tailor pretends to be asleep and brags about his heroic deeds [K1951.3]. The soldiers flee in fear [K1951.2], and the tailor keeps his kingdom.

|1641      Doctor Know-All. A farmer named Crab (Cricket, Rat) dresses as a doctor and calls himself Doctor Know-All [K1956]. In exchange for food and lodging for three days, he offers to dis- cover who stole a ring (treasure) from a rich man (king). He is to be hanged if he fails. When servants enter the room (at the end of the three days), he says, “That is the first (second, third)”. The servants believe he has discovered their theft, and admit to having stolen the ring [N611.1]. To prove his power, he must say what is inside a covered dish (closed fist). He has no idea and bemoans, “Poor Crab (Cricket, Rat)!” He is lucky that this is the right answer [N688]. He gives a purgative to a person whose horse had been stolen. When the person has to go outside, he discovers his missing horse [K1956.1]. Or Dr. Know-All hides the horse himself and then dis- covers it [K1956.2]. In variants from northern Europe, he becomes a clergyman. He impresses the local farmers with his short and incomprehensible sermons (when his pulpit suddenly collapses, because it had been sawed through. Cf. Type 1825C [K1961.1.3]).

1641C*   “Do Not Postpone till Tomorrow What You Can Do Today.” A farmer asks a seemingly-clever lawyer if he can buy some “good advice” (“intelligence”). The lawyer writes something on a piece of paper, puts it into an envelope, and gives it to the farmer. The farmer pays him for this. The following day, the farmer and his workmen cannot decide whether or not they should mow the hay (grain). The farmer opens the letter, which says, “Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today”. They cut the hay and store it. Suddenly it begins to rain, and they see the wisdom of the lawyer’s advice.

|1642      The Good Bargain. This anecdote is comprised of various motifs and episodes from other humorous tales. A foolish farmer performs various senseless actions that turn out to be to his advantage: Because he misunderstands the croaking of frogs, he throws money  into the pond for them to count [JI851.1.1]. He sells meat to a dog, expecting it to carry it to the butcher [JI852]. Or, he puts goods to be sold to a signpost [J1853, J1853.1]. When he returns for his money and does not receive it, he com- plains to the king (takes the dog to court) and thus causes the melan- choly princess to laugh [H341] (cf. Type 559). He declines to marry her and is offered a different reward, which he promises to a guard (soldier) and a Jew. The king orders a beating instead of money, and the Jew receives the blows [K187] (cf. Type 1610, cf. Type 1689A). The Jew takes the farmer to court, loaning him his coat (boots). At the trial, the farmer denies that he has borrowed the coat and thus renders the Jew’s testimony unbelievable (makes the Jew ap pear to be insane) [J1151.2] (cf. Type 1642A).

|1643      Money Inside the Statue (previously The Broken Image). A woman sends her foolish son to sell some linen (cow, other wares), telling him not to deal with people who talk too much. The son takes this literally and refuses to sell to anyone who asks the price of the cloth. He sells the cloth (cow, other goods) to a statue (crucifix) because it does not speak, and says he will come back the next day for the money. His mother is dismayed when being told at her son’s stupid bargain. When he goes back to get the money, the cloth has been stolen and the statue will not speak. Angry, the son throws a stone at the statue. It breaks and inside is a pot of money (treasure) which he mis takes for beans [J1853.1.1, N510]. Cf. Type 1696.

|1645A     Dream of Treasure Bought. (Guntram.) A king falls asleep under a tree. A servant observes an animal creep out of his mouth [E721, E730], run to a stream, and try to cross it. The servant lays his sword across the stream, and the animal runs over it and into an opening in a mountain. Later the animal goes back into the mouth of the sleeping king. The king awakes and relates that he dreamed that he went over a stream on an iron bridge and entered a mountain where he found a great treasure. The servant tells the king what he had observed. The king looks into the mountain and discovers the great treasure, which he donates to the church. In many variants, someone else buys the dream and then finds the treasure [N531.3].

|1645B     Dream of Marking the Treasure. A man dreams that he finds a treas ure (is told where a treasure is buried). It is too heavy for him to carry so he marks the place with his own excrement. In the morning he finds that only the end of this dream was true: he has defecated in his bed [X31]. Cf. Type 1407A*. In later European variants, a man (farmer, gambler, rich man, poor man, miser, clergyman, fool, married couple) lights a candle to the devil (saint) (cf. Type 778*). That night he dreams that the devil took him to a place where a treasure was buried. The devil tells him to mark the place with his excrement. Again, only the end of the dream is true.

|1646      The Lucky Blow. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man pulls the crown (turban) off the king’s head and throws it on the ground. A snake comes out of it and the king be lieves that the man saved his life [N656]. (2) A man is angry at the king. He drags him out of the palace and into the courtyard (to beat him). The floor of the throne room gives way and the king thinks the man has saved his life [N688.1].

|1650      The Three Lucky Brothers. A poor man dies, leaving his three sons only a rooster, a cat [N411.1.1] (cf. Type 545B) and something else (musical instrument, scythe [N411.2.1], rake, flail, winnowing shovel, hammer, millstone, ax, etc.). This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Each son takes his inheritance to a foreign country where it is unknown and sells it there for a fortune [N411]. A king buys the rooster because he thinks that it makes the sun rise. Fools who had used awls to harvest their grain pay generously for the scythe (cf. Types 1202, 1203, and 1203A) [N411.2]. The cat is sold at a high price in a country plagued by rats where cats were unknown (cf. Types 1281, 1651). Or, the inhabitants flee because they are afraid that the cat will devour everything, not just the rats. (2) The brothers turn their inheritance into riches by some other means. For example, the millstone falls down onto robbers who are counting their treasure; the robbers flee leaving the money behind (cf. Type 1653). Or, one brother who has inherited a rope uses it by the shore to make sandals. The devil comes out of the water and asks what he is doing, and he replies that he is making a trap for the devil (to tie the lake together). The devil offers him gold in exchange for the rope (cf. Type 1045). Or, one of the brother inherits a musical instrument (fiddle) that makes wolves dance. He is given money when he threatens to let the enchanted wolves go free (to call them back) (cf. Type 1652).

|1651        Whittington’s Cat. A youth (man, merchant, poor woman) buys a cat and gives it to a merchant (gentleman) to take away on his ship (caravan) and sell (the owner himself takes it on a journey). The cat is taken to a country (island, Africa, India) where there are no cats. This country is so overrun with mice (rats, snakes) that the inhabi t- ants cannot sleep for fear of being bitten; or, while eating, they have to defend themselves from the animals’ attacks with cudgels and hammers. The man demonstrates the cat’s ability to hunt and sells it for a high price. (The cat returns to him twice, so he is able to sell it three times .) The merchant intends not to give the money to the cat’s owner, but a storm (miracle) convinces him to be honest. The  young man who was the cat’s original owner marries the merchant’s daughter (a princess in the foreign land) [N411.1]. Cf. Types 1281, 1650.

|1653      The Robbers under the Tree. (Including the previous Types 1653A–F.) This tale exists chiefly in five different forms: (1) Travelers (a single traveler) in need of a place to spend the night climb a tree. While they are hidden in the branches, robbers (rich people) settle under the tree to count their booty (to have a feast). The people in the tree overhear the activity below and let some thing (e.g. a door, cf. Type 1009) fall (accidentally). It lands on the robbers, frightening them so that they flee and leave their valu- ables behind. The travelers keep the booty and thus become rich [K335.1.1]. Cf. Types 1009, 1650, and 1875. (2) On leaving home, a husband tells his wife (wife tells her hus- band, mother tells her son) to mind (shut or lock) the door, but in- stead she takes it with her [K1413]. At night they climb a tree. The door falls, frightening robbers who flee and leave their booty behind [K335.1.1.1]. (3) Two (more) brothers exclude their youngest brother from their thieving expeditions because they think he is a fool. In order to get his own wealth, he climbs a tree, taking a door (corpse, mill stone) along with him. He lets it fall on robbers who have gathered under the tree. They run away, leaving their booty behind [K335.1.1.1, K335.1.2.1]. (Previously Types 1653B and 1653C.) Cf. Types 326B*, 1525R. (4) A person in a tree drops part of a dead animal (head, in tes- tines, hide) on rich people (robbers) who are enjoying a feast under the tree [K335.1.1.2]. (Previously Types 1653D and 1653E.) (5) Robbers overhear a foolish man (woman) talking to himself. The robbers misinterpret the words, think they have been discover ed, and flee, leaving their booty behind [K335.1, N611, N611.2, N612]. (Previously Type 1653F.)

|1654       The  Robbers  in  the  Death  Chamber.  Two  farmers  (friends,  poor people )  disagree  about  a  bargain  (found  money):  one  thinks  he has been cheated and wants to get even, or they try to cheat each other . When the creditor demands payment (that the contract be ful- filled), the debtor pretends to be dead. He is taken to the church (temple, tomb; buried in a grave) where the creditor holds a vigil. During the night, robbers come by to divide their booty. The seemingly-dead man sits up suddenly and cries out, “Get up, all you dead people!” The creditor replies, “Here we are!” The robbers, thinking the dead are coming out after them, flee. The creditor and the debtor share their wealth [K335.1.2.2].

|1655      The Profitable Exchange. A poor man finds a bean (pea, grain of millet) which is eaten by a rooster. The old woman who owns the rooster gives it to the man. When the rooster is eaten by a pig, he is given the pig. A steer (cow) kills the pig, and he takes the steer as com pensation. Similarly, the man is given a horse as compensation for the steer [K251.1]. Cf. Type 170. Eventually he demands a woman (princess) as compensation and puts her into a sack. His luck turns: strangers set her free and replace her with a big dog who jumps out and attacks the man [K526].

|1656      How the Jews Were Lured Out of Heaven [X611]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) In heaven, St. Peter announces that a favorite food (drink) is available elsewhere. All the members of some group (municipal council, scissors-grinders, cowherds, robbers, etc.) run out of heaven after it. In some variants, Jews are evacuated from heaven with the cry, “Clothes are being auctioned off in hell!” (2) A group of soldiers have entered heaven illegally. St. Peter lures  them out with a simulated roll call. Or, coastal inhabitants (noisy  violinists) are expelled from heaven. Cf. Types 800, 801.

|1659       Late Satisfaction. A man applies for a job as a hotel porter (sexton, ticket-seller for a movie theater), but he is not hired because he can- not read or write. He emigrates and, through a series of lucky cir- cum stances, becomes wealthy. When he goes back home to visit, he stays at a hotel where he is asked to fill out a form, and it becomes obvious that he is illiterate. The porter remarks, “Whatever could you have done if you had been able to read?” The man answers, “I would have been a porter in this hotel”.

|1661      The Triple Tax. A poet (farmer) receives the right to demand a tax from the first afflicted person (hunchback, leper, one-eyed man, etc.) he meets and from everyone with a certain name and also from every- one from a certain city. When he meets the first hunchbacked person and explains the situation, it happens that the man is also of that name and from that city (suffers also from the other handicaps). The poet demands more money from him as he reveals each of these circumstances, but the hunchbacked man refuses to pay [N635, J2225].

|1663      Dividing Five Eggs Equally between Two Men and One Woman. A king sets a task: five eggs must be divided among one woman and two men in such a way that each has three eggs. A clever woman solves the problem: each man gets one, because he already has two [testicles], and she herself takes the remaining three [J1249.1]. In some variants, a father gives three eggs to his three daughters. Whichever of them best multiplies her eggs will be the first to marry. The oldest gives one to her father, saying, “You already have two, so that makes three”. She gives one to her mother, saying, “In the night, when father gives you his two eggs, you will also have three. I will keep one for myself, and when I am married I will have three eggs”. Neither of her sisters is able to give so clever an answer, so she is the first to marry. Cf. Type 1533B.

|1675         The Ox (Ass) as Mayor. Tricksters (students, a butcher) fool a farmer into thinking that his ox (calf, donkey) is so clever that it should be sent to school. The farmer gives them money for its tuition [K491], and they take it away and sell (slaughter) it. Later when the farmer wants to visit his ox, they tell him that it has graduated and is now the mayor (a judge, lawyer) of another city [J1882.2]. The farmer is offended by the animal’s ingratitude and goes to find it. He demands to see the mayor (who is named Ox or has the same name as the ox). The mayor summons help to throw the angry farmer out. Or, the farmer beats the mayor until he pays back the tuition money. Cf. Type 1750A.

|1681      The Boy’s Disasters. Miscellaneous type. A stupid man (boy) acci- dentally kills his horse (dog). He throws his axe into a river (lake) because he wants to kill a pike (duck). When he goes into the water naked to retrieve his ax, his clothes are stolen. He falls into vats of tar and feathers and returns home covered in feathers. His dog does not recognize him and bites him. Inside his house, he kicks the baby to death. He bumps a knife which falls from the cupboard and cuts off his penis. After this, his wife sends him away [J2661.4]. Some versions add other accidents: the man hides naked in the cellar, becomes drunk and lets the wine run out of the cask, uses the flour to dry the floor, and stops the cask with the head of a hen. He tries to hatch her eggs but instead he breaks them and becomes covered in egg and bran (honey or tar and feathers). He is mistaken for the devil. Cf. Types 1387, 1408.

|1681A     Preparations for the Wedding (previously Fool Prepares for the Wed- ding [Funeral]). A stupid young man (bridegroom) buys pots at the market. When his shadow frightens him, he throws the pots at it. When he gathers wood in the forest, he thinks the bare trees must be cold and covers them with his clothes (cf. Type 1271C*). Frighten ed by a dead dog, the boy gives it his food so it will not bite him. He smears butter on the path (cf. Type 1291B) to ease the horse’s burden and throws salt in the river to make it taste better. When horse-flies bother his horse, the boy hits them, killing the horse. He kills a cow and “sells” its meat to dogs (frogs) [J1852] (cf. Type 1642). Although he has nothing for dinner, he invites guests whom he astonishes with his bad manners. In some variants, the accidents happen to a foolish married couple  who are going to visit their married daughter.

|1685      The Foolish Bridegroom. Miscellaneous type. (Including the previ- ous Type 1685A.) A young bachelor (bridegroom, often a trick ster) proves his stupidity through a series of absurd mistakes (fol lows his master’s advice literally in order to injure him). The follow ing episodes are the most common: (1) Left alone at home, the fool is instructed to put a certain ingre- dient (e.g. parsley) in the food he is cooking. He puts the dog (cat) that is named Parsley into the soup [J2462.1]. (2) The fool is told to clean a certain area. He takes this order lit- erally and throws out everything that is in it [J2465.5]. (3) When he goes courting, he is advised to cast eyes at the girl. He puts out the eyes of animals (often sheep) and throws them at her [J2462.2]. In some cases, the metaphoric meaning of the gesture is understood; in others, the young woman rejects the foolish suitor [J2462.2]. Cf. Type 1006. Additional episodes come from the following groups of types: 1000–1029, 1200–1349, 1350–1439, 1525–1539, 1640–1674, and 1675– 1724. In some versions, the protagonist is a stupid son-in-law.

|1686      The Wedding Night. Miscellaneous type. (Including the previous Type 1686**.) A stupid bridegroom does not know what to do on his wedding night [J1744.1]. His mother (parents, bride) gives him advice, but he misunderstands it and injures himself, or causes some other acci- dent. In some variants, he finds a man in the bed and thinks his bride has turned into a man. (Previously Type 1686**.) On the wedding night, the bride wants to leave her husband be- cause of his foolishness. She says she has to go out. He does not trust her, so he ties her to a rope. She goes out, frees herself, and ties the rope to a goat. In the dark, the bridegroom at first does not notice the sub stitution. When he feels the animal’s body (beard, testicles, horns), he asks his mother about them. She does not know about the substitution and explains that these are normal parts of the bride’s body [K1223.1].

The mother-in-law tells her son that he should do what dogs do. The next morning, the wife wants to divorce her husband. The mother-in-law asks the wife what happened.

He looks in the ground to find the forgotten word (fools think the earth swallowed it, and try to dig it out). A passer-by asks him what he is doing and coincidentally speaks the word. The boy is delighted that the word has been found again.

|1688      The Servant to Improve on the Master’s Statements. A wealthy suitor wants to impress a young woman whom he is wooing. He engages a friend (servant) not only to attest to his wealth but to double the worth of all things he names. When the suitor admits that he has a weakness (weak eye, cough), the friend exaggerates and says that he cannot see at all, or that he coughs even more at night [J2464]. This upsets the bride and she calls off the marriage. Cf. Types 859, 1920E.

1688A*  Jealous Suitors. (Including the previous Type 1688B*.) Two men are wooing the same woman. Each schemes to outdo the other and have her to himself. For example, one skins the legs of four of his oppo nent’s horses and rolls the skin up to the knees. The other gets revenge by cutting off the upper lips of four of his opponent’s horses, saying that they are laughing at the horses wearing stockings. In another version, a poor suitor triumphs over his rich rival through various machinations and wins the woman for his wife. (Previously Type 1688B*.)

|1689A     Two Presents for the King. A man (farmer, gardener) produces a huge turnip (cf. Type 1960) and takes it to the king as a present. The king rewards him well. His neighbor (gentleman, noble, rich man) learns about this and decides to give the king a much better present (his daughter in marriage), in the hope of an even better reward [J2415.1]. The king gives him the giant turnip as his reward. Some variants, including the literary text, continue as follows: The duped rich man wants to revenge himself and lures the farmer into the forest to kill him. He and his men put the farmer into a sack and tie it up in a tree, but when a traveling scholar comes by, they run away. The farmer calls to the scholar, pretendings that he can see the whole world from inside the sack. The scholar takes his place and the farmer rides away on the scholar’s horse. Cf. Type 1535. In some variants, the farmer sends someone back to rescue the scholar.

His potential mother- in-law makes a remark about the weather, but the bridegroom mis- understands and thinks she is referring to his appetite (pun). He re plies that he is not eating her food.

His mother rebukes him for his bad table manners and tells him what he should have done (use a knife and fork). The next time he goes out wooing, he does what she advised, but the situation is different (he tries to eat peas or nuts with a knife and fork). The story continues in this manner and he never manages to get married. Cf. Types 1685, 1696.

|1692      The Stupid Thief. A fool joins a band of robbers. They send him into a house to steal while the rest of them wait outside. He bungles the job in one of several ways [J2136]: He takes the robbers’ instructions literally. They tell him to bring some thing substantial (i.e. valuable), and he brings something heavy (e.g. a mortar) [J2461.1.7]. They tell him to bring something shiny (i.e. gold), and he brings a mirror [J2461.1.7.1]. The fool awakens the household. He wants to take more than he can carry, so he wakes the owner and asks him for help [J2136.5.6]. The fool finds a musical instrument and plays it loudly [J2136.5.7]. He decides to cook something to eat. Hearing the owner sigh in his sleep, the fool thinks he must be hungry, so he puts hot food in his mouth (hand) [J2136.5.5]. Cf. Types 177, 1693.

|1694      The Company to Sing like the Leader. Two (drunken) men (married couple, a group of people) on their way home from a market day (wedding) try to sing together. The leader’s foot becomes caught in a wheel. He (she) cries for help, but no one understands; the cry is taken  to be part of the song and is thus repeated by the group [J2417.1]. Often the leader’s foot is broken before the wagon is stop ped. In a Berber variant, a teacher from the city is supposed to teach prayers from the Koran to men in the mountains. They stand out side and repeat the words of the prayers after him. The teacher bows to the ground and touches a board, which he is using to protect himself from the mud, with his forehead. His nose becomes wedged in the board. The teacher calls for help, but the companions take this for part of the prayer and repeat the words zealously. The teacher tears his nose away, leaving the tip behind. He tells the companions they must first learn Arabic, and departs. Cf. Types 1246, 1825D*, and 1832M*.

The leader stumbles and falls (spills the food on the table or on the floor), and the others do likewise [J2417.2]. In his anger over the accident, the mayor curses, e.g. , “Go to the devil!” The others add, as they had rehearsed, “With your wife and children”, “and your aunts and uncles”, “and the noble lady, and the whole company!” [J1845]. (Previously Type 1698C*.) In German and Austrian variants, the inhabitants cannot decide what to wear. When the visiting dignitary arrives, they hurry, still naked, to greet him. When the mayor is bitten on his backside by a horse-fly, he uses his hand to shoo it away, and all the others copy this gesture. In other variants, the reception goes wrong for other reasons. Cf. Types 1246, 1297*, 1821, and 1832M*.

|1695      Shoes  for  Animals  (previously  The  Fool  Spoils  the  Work  of  the Shoemaker, the Tailor, and the Smith). A man (fool, Eulenspiegel) who works for a shoemaker is supposed to cut some leather for shoes. He asks his master, “How (big) should I make them?” and is told, “Big and small, just as the herdsman drives them through the gate”. The man makes shoes for pigs (sheep). When the master sees this, he throws the man out. Or, they take the shoes to market and tell customers that the winter will be so cold, even the animals will need shoes [J1873.1]. The customers pay well for the shoes.

|1696      “What Should I Have Said (Done)?” Miscellaneous type. (Including the previous Type 1696A*.) A mother tells her stupid son (man tells his wife) what he should have said (done) in a particular situation. The son follows the advice at the next opportunity, where it turns out to be inappropriate. He is punished (is told again what he should have done or said, and he follows that advice in the wrong circum- stances, etc.) For example, the fool congratulates mourners and offers sympathy to a bridal couple [J2461, J2461.2].

|1697      “We Three; For Money.” Three Valaisans (men of another nation ality) who are going to England (another foreign country) learn in advance some important English phrases (cf. Types 1699, 1699B). The first one learns to state who they are: “We three Valaisans”. The second one learns how to convince a prospective landlord to give them food and lodging: “For the money”. The third one learns to agree to a stipulated price: “That’s right”. On their journey they are accused falsely of having committed a murder. The judge asks who committed the crime, and the first man answers, “We three Valaisans”. The judge asks why they did it, and the second man says, “For the money”. The judge condemns them to be hanged, and the third man responds, “That’s right”. The three men are hanged (or, the real culprit is found and the three men are freed). Cf. Type 360. 

Combinations: 360. 
Remarks: Documented in the 14th century by John Bromyard, Summa predi cantium

|1698A     Search for the Lost Animal. One deaf person has lost sheep (other ani mals) and, while he is looking for them, meets another deaf per- son. Neither recognizes the other’s disability. A asks if B has seen his sheep. B misunderstands but gestures in a certain direction as he re plies about something else. A goes in that direction and finds his sheep. He thanks B and offers him one of his animals which is de form ed (lame, etc.) as a reward for his help. B thinks A is blaming him for the animal’s deformity. They fight. They take their argument to a judge, who, unknown to either of them, is also deaf. His judg- ment is absurd [X111.1].

The traveler repeats his question and the deaf man refuses to sell his animal. His deaf mother brings his dinner. When he tells her about the traveler’s offer, she thinks he is tell ing her that the food is too salty. The daughter-in-law misunder stands what her mother-in-law says about the salty food, etc. The whole family is deaf and they all misunderstand each other [X111.2].

|1698D     The Wedding Invitation. A landlord meets a deaf farmer and asks him how much he wants for the livestock he has with him. The farmer thinks he is being asked about his daughter’s wedding, and tells about this. The landlord asks if he may come, and the farmer replies with the price of the livestock. The landlord says that the farmer is crazy, but the farmer thinks he is wishing him well, and returns the good wish [X111.4].

|1698G     Misunderstood Words Lead to Comic Results. Miscellaneous type. (Including the previous Types 1698F and 1698L.) A deaf person mis- under stands similar-sounding words, which leads to unexpected (comic) results or dialog. Cf. Type 1698N. In some cases, someone feigns deafness in order to avoid an obli- gation or some other unpleasant situation. In others, a hearing person wants to make fun of a deaf person but is embarrassed by his answers [X111.6].

|1698J     The Misunderstood Greeting (previously “Good Day,”– “A Wood- chopper.”). (Including the previous Type 1698E.) A traveler (noble- man) greets (questions, insults) a deaf workman (farmer, fisher man), but the workman answers as if the traveler had meant to com ment on his work [X111.5, C111.10]. Often the workman had imagined what a potential interlocutor would say to him and had rehearsed his answers. Or, he pretends to be deaf because he is afraid that the traveler will ask him to do some thing he does not want to do (e.g. lend him something). Cf. Types 1698N, 1699B.

The minister confesses his sins publicly in the church: “In the morning I have a drink” (spoken loudly), “and after that five or six little drinks” (spoken softly). “At noon I have another drink” (loudly), “and then five or six small ones” (softly). The bishop, who hears only the loud words, tells the congregation that the minister has the right to have a drink with his meals, and finds him innocent of the charges [X111.13].

|1699       Misunderstanding Because of Ignorance of a Foreign Language (in- clud ing the previous Type 1699A). Miscellaneous type. Two people who speak different languages cannot understand each other. One of them pronounces the words so that they seem to have a different meaning, or the words sound like different words in the other per- son’s language. Often an absurd conversation leads to unexpect ed events [J2496.2, X111.7]. Cf. Types 1322, 1700. In some variants the misunderstanding happens because one person does not understand a foreign word (technical term). Or an ambiguous message (statement) leads to the discovery of a criminal (planned crime) [N275.2]. (Previously Type 1699A.) Cf. Type 1697.

|1700      “I Cannot Understand You.” (Previously “I Don’t Know.”) A traveler (apprentice) comes to a city in a foreign country (usually Amster dam, but also Paris, Hamburg, Vienna, Moscow, etc.) where he sees a beau- tiful building (villa, palace, factory). Curious, he asks a passer-by, “Whom does it belong to?” The passer-by replies, “I can not under- stand you”, which the traveler misunderstands and takes to be the name of the owner. Similarly, he asks other people in turn the name of the husband of a beautiful woman, of the winner of the lottery, or the owner of a ship. He is amazed at the wealth of Mr. “I Cannot Understand You”. He becomes reconciled to his own modest circumstances when, as he follows a funeral procession, he learns that Mr. “I Cannot Under- stand You” has died [J2496]. Cf. Types 314, 1545, and 1699.

|1706D     How the Drunken Man Was Cured. (Including the previous Type 835*.) A wife cures her husband of his alcoholism by a ruse. When the husband is drunk, she organizes a funeral procession, lays him in a coffin and puts a shroud (fool’s costume) on him [J2311]. When the drunk husband awakes he thinks he is dead. Later, believing that he has been revived by his wife, the man swears he will never drink any more. Or, a drunken man lies under the bed and thinks he is lying in his shroud. This cures him of his alcoholism [X811].) Cf. Types 1313A*, 1531. In some versions the drinker is uncurable. When his wife, dis- guised as a ghost, brings him food, he tells her, “If you had known me better you would have brought me drink”. The wife ca pitu lates [J1323].

|1725      The Lover Discovered (previously The Foolish Parson in the Trunk). A farmer and his servant are plowing. The servant goes home to overhear the farmwife and her lover (often a clergyman). The lover hides. The servant pretends that he is supposed to do some job that threatens the lover’s hiding place: light the oven, clean the chimney, clean the wool. He is about to throw a chest in which the lover is hiding into water or to throw it down the stairs (he lets the lover free in return for a ransom). The lover hides in the calf’s stall and the servant drives him out with a whip. The wife wants to bring food outdoors to her lover, whose where- abouts she thinks she can locate by following certain signs along the way. The servant manages to alter the signs (e.g. he puts cloth on a horse to change its color) so that the wife brings the food to him instead [K1571]. The wife sends the servant to take food to her lover (to invite him to a meal). The servant drops the food on the way and tells the lover that the husband has discovered the adultery. On his way back, he tells the farmer that the lover has refused to come. Or, he says that the lover wants the farmer to help him repair his broken plow [K1573]. When the lover sees the farmer collecting the food strewn along the way, he thinks he is coming with the tools or going to attack him, so he runs away. Meanwhile, the servant has told the wife that her husband knows about her adultery, so she runs away. He tells the farmer that she left because her village (house) burned down. Or that she had promised always to cook food just as good as she did today if her husband can catch up with her. The farmer immediately goes after her. (Cf. Type 1741.) In the end, the wife confesses and she (and her lover) are possibly punished [K1572]. Cf. Types 1358, 1358A–1358C.

|1731      The Youth and the Pretty Shoes. A young man goes to a clergyman’s house and seduces the servant girl, the daughter, and the wife. He promises to give them each a beautiful pair of shoes which he has stolen [T455.3.1]. Instead, he threatens to expose them to the clergy- man and makes them pay him not to tell. Cf. Types 1420A–D. In some variants, he also tricks the clergyman. He gives him medi- cine for his bald (mangy) head and orders him to say, “I know what I know, but I will not tell”. The clergyman does this and the women confess their sexual liasons to him.

|1734*     Whose Cow Was Gored? (An eye for an eye.) A sexton hears the preach er give a sermon about the biblical phrase, “an eye for an eye”. When the preacher’s cow gores the sexton’s cow with its horns and kills it, the sexton wants the preacher to give him a new cow. The preacher refuses. It would have been different, though, if the sexton’s cow had killed the preacher’s. Cf. Type 1589.

|1735         “Who  Gives  His  Own  Goods  Shall  Receive  It  Back  Tenfold.” A preach er gives a sermon saying that whoever gives alms will receive them back tenfold [J1262.5.1]. A farmer brings him his only cow. In the eve ning, she goes back home to the farmer, and all the preacher’s cows follow her. The farmer wants to keep all the cows because God has sent them to him [K366.1.1]. The farmer and the preacher agree that the cows will belong to whichever of them says, “Good morning” to the other first [K176]. The farmer stays secretly in the preacher’s house and sees that the preacher spends the night with his female servant. In the morning, the farmer greets the preacher and lets him know that he is aware of his liason. The preacher lets the farmer keep the cows.

|1735A        The Wrong Song (previously The Bribed Boy Sings the Wrong Song). A clergyman is so miserly that he will not give the farmers any parts of the hogs he has slaughtered (cf. Type 1792). The sexton (teacher, poor farmers) steals one of his hogs (cow, sheep, ham). The clergy- man overhears the young son (daughter) of the sexton singing, “My father stole the clergyman’s hog”. The clergyman praises the child for the song and promises to give him money and clothes (shoes, a picture) if he will sing it on Sunday in church. The child tells his father (the father becomes suspicious), who teaches him another song. On Sunday, the clergyman announces from the pulpit, “What this child sings is true”. The child sings, “The clergyman has slept with my mother (all the women in the village)”. [K1631]. (Or, “All the children with red hair belong to the clergy man” – cf. Type 1805*). The clergyman tries to deny this, but the farmers mock him and he has to leave the church (loses his position, dies from shame).

|1736A     Sword Turns to Wood. A king disguises himself and visits an inn. There he meets a soldier who has sold his saber to buy drinks. The king asks him how he will salute, and the soldier replies that he has bigger problems than that. He later substitutes a wooden sword for his saber. The next day, the king orders the soldier to behead his friend (another man). The soldier prays to God to turn his sword into a piece of wood so that he will not have to kill his friend (if the man is innocent). The king forgives him.

|1736B     The Firm Belief. King Friedrich II of Prussia asks a soldier what he believes. The soldier says he believes what the shoemaker believes. The king asks what that is, and the soldier explains that he owes the shoemaker for a pair of boots but the shoemaker believes he will not be paid for them. The soldier also believes this. The king gives him money to pay the shoemaker. Later the king asks the soldier if he ever payed for the boots. The soldier replies that he and the shoe maker would not alter their beliefs for such a small amount of money.

|1737         The Clergyman in the Sack to Heaven. A man (master thief) is or- der ed to capture the preacher and put him into a sack. He dresses as an angel (Gabriel, Michael, angel of death) or as a saint (Peter) and waits at night near the church (parsonage, cemetery, pulpit) to con duct the preacher to heaven alive. The credulous preacher willingly gets into the sack (chest, trunk), and the man takes him to the goose house (bell tower, chim ney; hangs him by the gate). The next day, the preacher is discovered by his maidservant as she feeds the geese (bell-ringer as he rings the bells). She lets him out of the sack. Cf. Types 1525A, 1535.

|1738      The Dream: All Clergymen in Hell. (Including the previous Types 1738A* and 1738C*.) Three main versions of this story can be distin- guished: (1) A priest refuses to go to the deathbed of one of his parish- ioners to perform the last rites, because the man has not come to church (for another reason). The sick man recovers and meets the priest. He tells him that he dreamed (that it really happened) that he died and went to the gate of heaven. St. Peter would not let him in because he had not received the last rites. The sick man had asked if he could not receive them postumously in heaven. Peter explained that there are no priests in heaven: they are all in hell [X438]. Often continued by Type 1860A. Also told of other professions (e.g. law- yers, commissioners of police), ethnic groups (e.g. Scots, Jews), and rich people (noblemen). (2) A fool comes down a hill. The clergyman asks him where he comes from. He answers, “From above”. The clergyman asks him what God is doing up there [H797.2]. The fool answers, “He is won- dering why there are so few clergymen in heaven”. Cf. Types 922, 1833C. (Previously Type 1738A*.) (3) In order to enter heaven, a clergyman and a sexton are re quired to make a chalk mark for each of their sins on the stairs. The clergy- man has to go back and get more chalk. Cf. Type 1848. (Previ ously Type 1738C*.)

1738B*   The Clergyman’s Dream. On Sunday morning, a preacher warns his parishioners from the pulpit that their contributions are overdue. He says that he dreamed that he died and went to heaven. There, he was overcome by an urgent need, and asked St. Peter if he could go to the toilet. When he looked down the hole, he saw his village under neath him. He told St. Peter that he could not use that hole because he would soil his parishioners. In response, St. Peter asked him if this would not serve them right, since they did not pay their contributions.

|1739      The Clergyman and the Calf. A man (usually a clergyman) who has a stomach ache sends his servant (maid) to the doctor with a sample of his urine. On the way the bottle breaks, and the servant fills a new bottle with urine from a pregnant cow (mare). The doctor diagnoses that the man will give birth to a calf (cf. Type 1862C). The man be- lieves him (and goes away embarrassed). Some time later (in a stall, when he is drunk, after taking a laxative) he evacuates his bowels. He happens to see a calf there and believes it to be his child [J2321.1]. Cf. Type 1319.

1739A*  A Miser Gives Birth to a Child (previously Man Thinks he has Given  Birth to a Child by Letting Wind). A miserly man who has been married many times will not give his wife anything that she can cook to make a meal. Then, to punish her for not cooking, he stops up her nose and ears and leaves her. Another young woman takes revenge (cf. Type 1408B): She marries the miser, secretly takes some of his money, and gives him so much food that it gives him a stom ach ache. Then she tells him that he is pregnant. When he farts (dur ing his sleep), she puts a newborn baby in his arms. He is so embar rassed that he leaves home [J2321.2].

|1740      Candles on the Crayfish. At night (Halloween) a man (rascal, thief, trickster, clergyman) sticks lights (candles) on the backs of living crayfish (crabs, beetles) and sets the animals loose in a room (the graveyard). Gullible people take them for spirits (devils, souls from Purgatory) and are frightened (run away, pay money for a mass, let  them selves  be  put  into  a  sack  to  be  conveyed  to  “heaven”) [K335.0.5.1].

|1741      The Priest’s Guest and the Eaten Chickens. A man (priest) directs his wife (cook, maidservant) to cook two chickens (geese, hares, fish) for a dinner to which he has invited a guest (the clergyman). The wife and her lover secretly eat (nibble at) the fowl. Before (during) the dinner, as her husband sharpens his carving knife, she tells the guest that her husband intends to cut his ears (testicles) off. The guest runs away. She tells her husband that the guest took the chickens with him. The husband chases after him, crying, “At least give me one of them!” [K2137]. Cf. Type 1725. In some variants, the wife tells the guest that her husband in- tends to put the pestle up his backside (oven-fork in his mouth). The husband runs after him, crying, “Let me put it in just a little way!”

|1744        In Purgatory. (Including Type 1833G.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A clergyman demands repeated payments from a dying man (the man’s relatives) who wants to buy his way out of Purgatory. The man asks if his place in heaven is guaranteed. The clergyman replies, “Nearly”. (He has his hand on the doorknob to heaven, the fire in purgatory is only as high as his knees.) The dying man (his rela tives) says that he can take care of himself from here. (2) An old woman asks a clergyman whether her deceased hus- band is in heaven or in hell. He asks for a donation and she gives him some money. After a while the clergyman tells her that her husband is  still burning in hell (up to his knee) and she should give more money to save him. The old woman refuses, saying that her husband always  had cold feet. Or,  an  old  woman  asks  the  clergyman  if  it  is  warm  enough in heaven, or if she would be better off in hell. (Previously Type  1833G.)

|1750        The Hen Learns to Speak (previously The Parson’s Stupid Wife). A mercenary lover makes the clergyman’s foolish wife (a neighbor woman who has discovered the liason) believe that a hen (chickens) can be taught to talk (sing) [J1882.1]. The woman gives him the hen (eggs to hatch) and feed for it. (The man eats the hen or eggs.) When the woman asks what the hen (chickens) has learned to say, the man answers, that it can say, “The clergyman’s wife has slept with the farmer”. She lets him keep the hen and feed (bribes him not to tell anyone) [K1271.1.3].

|1775      The Hungry Clergyman. This type combines one of two introductory episodes with a common main part. Introductory episodes: (1) Cf. Type 1691. (2) Master and servant (clergyman and sexton) go hunting (in the forest). The servant brings food but the master does not. When they become hungry, the servant eats his food privately and tells the master that he is eating hay (horse droppings). In the evening they are tired when they come to a farm. The servant warns his master not to accept an invitation to eat when it is first offered. He also tells the farmer not to invite the master more than once, or he will be come angry. The master declines the first invitation, and it is not repeated. During the night, he goes out in search of food, and gives the servant the end of a rope to hold. The servant ties his end of the rope to the innkeeper’s bed, which motivates the next part of the tale. Main part: The hungry man eats his fill and wants to take some food to his companion. He winds up in the host’s bed and thinks the backside of the housewife is his companion’s face. When she farts, he thinks his companion is blowing on the food to cool it. Angry that the “man” will not eat, he slaps the porridge into his “face”. The woman wakes up and thinks she has soiled the bed [X431]. In some variants, the tale continues: The guest washes his messy hands in a jug and cannot get them out. Intending to break the jug on a stone, he breaks it instead on the bald head of the host or on the buttocks of the host’s wife, who has gotten up to clean herself.

The sexton pretends not to under- stand what the priest means. Intending to demonstrate, the priest exchanges places with the sexton (in the confessional, in the church). Acting as the priest, the sexton asks who visits (kisses, sleeps with) his wife when he is away. The priest pretends he cannot hear the question [X441.1].

|1791      The Sexton Carries the Clergyman. (Including the previous Type 1525F.) Two thieves (farmhands, apprentices) decide that one of them will steal cabbage (nuts) while the other steals a sheep (pig, horses). They plan to meet in the graveyard (tomb) at night to divide their booty. The man who took the cabbage arrives first and begins to divide: “One for me, one for you”. The sexton hears this and thinks it is a ghost (the devil, the Last Judgment). He brings the clergyman to come and hear this for himself. The clergyman is lame (suffers from rheumatism), so the sexton has to carry him on his back. The cabbage-thief thinks this must be his con federate with the sheep, and calls out, “Throw it here so we can slaugh ter it”. The sexton, terrified, drops his burden and runs away, but is overtaken by the clergyman who is so frightened that he for got about his injury [X424].

|1791*     The Murderers’ House. Two young men lose their way on an autumn evening and stay overnight in a secluded house. One of them hears the owner (sees him take a knife and) say, “No matter how young they are, they have to die”. (“It’s lucky that he is so fat.”) The young man thinks he and his friend are about to be murdered. It turns out that the owner was planning to kill two sheep (a rooster).

|1792      The Stingy Clergyman and the Slaughtered Pig. A clergyman (citi- zen, farmer), who has benefited from others’ communal slaughter ing parties, does not want to give away any of his own pig. His sexton (neighbor) advises him to hang the animal’s carcass outdoors over night and to take it inside secretly early in the morning. He can tell the neighbors that it was stolen. The clergyman follows this advice, but, in the night, the sexton comes and steals the pig. In the morning, the clergyman comes and complains that his pig really was stolen. The sexton pretends not to believe this, and tells the clergyman that his act is so convincing, no one will mind his not sharing the meat [K343.2.1]. Cf. Type 1831.

|1792B      The Clergyman and the Sexton Steal a Hog. A clergyman steals a hog, kills it, hides it in his boat, and rows away. When his followers ask him if he has seen a hog thief, he denies it. He takes the hog home where he shows it to the sexton, who thereupon wants to steal a hog as well. In the night, they plan to light the hog’s head with tinder, in order to kill the animal. But when in the darkness the clergyman puts the burning tinder for a moment on his own knee, the sexton thinks it is the hog’s head, and he cuts his companion’s knee with his axe. The cries of pain awaken the inhabitants of the house, and the two thieves are caught.

|1804      Imagined Penance for Imagined Sin. This tale exists chiefly in two dif ferent forms: (1) A penitent (young woman) comes to confession and says that he has planned to do something sinful. The clergyman answers that the thought is as good as the deed, and orders the penitent to pay a cer tain amount of money for his absolution. The penitent says that the sin was only imaginary, so the clergyman must accept an imagin - ary payment [J1551.2]. (2) After the confession of an imagined sin, a penitent is sup posed to work for the clergyman, but instead he lies under a tree. The clergy man asks him why he is not doing anything, and he an swers that his intention to work is as good as the deed.

The thief confesses that he stole a watch and offers to give it to the clergyman, who refuses it saying that the thief should return it to its owner. The thief says honestly that the owner has refused to accept it. The clergyman tells the thief that he may then keep the watch, and gives him absolution. Later, when the clergyman discovers his mistake, it is too late to get his watch back [K373]. In some variants, the clergyman wants the thief to announce his finding in public, but the thief reminds him that what is said in con- fession is secret.

|1807B     Sleeping with God’s Daughters. For his penance, a man is required to abstain for four weeks from eating flesh and drinking liquor, not to sleep in a feather bed, and to abstain from sexual relations with women. He goes to a convent where he is provided with meat and wine, and where he sleeps on a bed of down with the nuns. When he tells his confessor about this, the clergyman is angry at the man for sleep- ing with the daughters of God. The penitent replies that now that he is the brother-in-law of Jesus, he does not need a confessor any more [J1161.5].

1807A*   “Who Has Lost This?” A man comes to confession with a purse of money which he has found (a clergyman finds such a purse). In order to return it to its owner, the man is supposed to announce his finding in the city, but he speaks so softly (has hidden the purse so) that no one understands. Since no one claims the purse, the man is permitted to keep it.

|1810     Anecdotes about Catechism. This miscellaneous type consists of vari  ous anecdotes that are structured as a series of questions and answers about religious subjects. The clergyman tests the knowl- edge of one or more of his parishioners. The humor comes from the ignorance of the person questioned, from wrong answers, or from mis understandings evidenced in the answers. The questioner (clergy man) is often thought to be a fool by the person whom he inter ro gates. Cf. Type 1832*.

|1825      The Farmer as Clergyman. This type consists of three introductory episodes in which an unqualified person takes over the office of the clergyman but cannot fulfill his duties [K1961.1]. (1) A congregation is no longer able to pay the clergyman and chooses one of themselves (a stranger, someone who can read) to take his place. A wife induces her husband to volunteer to be the clergy- man, or a farmer in debt goes to the clergyman for instruction. (2) The clothes of a farmer who is drunk (asleep) are exchanged by his wife (a passer-by) with the clergyman’s. The farmer attempts to carry out the clergyman’s duties. (3) A farmer wants to exchange roles with a clergyman because he believes the clergyman has an easy life and only works on Sun- days.

|1825A     Preaching the Truth (previously The Parson Drunk). A congregation complains about their clergyman to the bishop. The bishop comes for a surprise visit. Before the service begins, the clergyman, who pretends to be asleep, witnesses the bishop propositioning his wife. The clergyman preaches about this in his sermon, and the bishop decides to drop the matter of the complaint [cf. J1211.1, K1961.1.1]. In some variants, the bishop instructs all the clergymen always to speak the truth in their sermons. When the bishop comes and hears a clergyman preaching about the bishop’s own misconduct, he removes the clergyman from his position.

|1825B     Preaching as the Congregation Wishes (previously “I Preach God’s Word.”). This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A congregation (master) requires that the clergyman preach an impromptu sermon on a text that has been placed in the pulpit. The page there is blank. The clergyman begins his sermon with the words, “From nothing, God created the heavens and the earth”. Some times he ends there. More often, the sermon that follows is con sidered a particularly good one. (2) A congregation complains that their clergyman, often a lay- man, knows no Latin. He goes to the sexton for advice. As they walk around, the sexton tells him some mock-Latin words which he makes  by adding endings onto familiar words. The clergyman copies this formula in his next sermon, and the congregation is appeased [K1961.1.2]. Cf. Type 1628*. (3) An ignorant clergyman repeats the same words over and over, e.g. “I preach the word of God”; “I am a good shepherd”; or, “Service and sermon”. [K1961.1.2].

Secretly, he saws the pulpit almost through. When in his next sermon he refers to the miracle, the pulpit falls down [K1961.1.3]. (2) A clergyman (monk) gesticulates wildly during his sermons. One of the parishioners saws the pulpit almost through. It falls down during the next sermon, while the clergyman cites John XVI,16, “A little while, and ye shall not see me”. Cf. Type 1827. (3) A clergyman preaches standing on a barrel that caves in dur- ing the sermon.

|1826      The Clergyman Has No Need to Preach. A clergyman (often a lay man, Nasreddin Hodja) asks his congregation whether they know what his sermon will be about. They do not know, so he berates them for their stupidity. He repeats his question the following week. This time they say they know, so he thinks he need not preach any more. The third week, the congregation is divided in their answer to the question: half say no and half say yes. The clergyman tells those who understand to teach the others [X452]. In some variants, a clergyman has to preach a sermon about a certain saint on the appropriate saint’s day. In order to avoid preach- ing this sermon, he announces that, since the saint performed no miracles that year, he need not give a sermon about him.

with the sermon about the saint appears in the 15th century bei Poggio, Liber

1826A*   The Saint Who Ran Away (previously The Escaped Saint.) A saint’s picture is stolen from a church. The clergyman thinks that the saint ran away because he was a bad clergyman. Cf. Type 1572A*. In some variants, a clergyman and a sexton remove a saint’s statue . It is found in a bean field. The clergyman tells the congre- gation that it had gone to look for some food because they gave so little money for it.

|1827      “You Shall See Me a Little While Longer.” A clergyman makes a bet with one member of his congregation that he will be able to empty a jug of wine during his sermon without being observed by the con- gre gation (an alcoholic clergyman depends on his liquor to preach his sermon). In order to be able to drink behind the pulpit, he preaches on John 16.16, “A little while, and ye shall not see me, and again a little while, and ye shall see me”. After the sermon the clergyman shows the empty jug and asks if someone had lost it. Cf. Type 1825C. In some variants the clergyman goes behind the pulpit to drink during the prayers [X445.1]. Cf. Types 1533A, 1839B.

|1828*     Weeping and Laughing. A clergyman makes a bet that he can give a sermon that will cause half the congregation to laugh and half to weep. Or, a clergyman wants to show his bishop (the lord of the area) how badly his congregation behaves. He preaches a moving sermon that causes half his audience to weep. But he wears no trousers under his gown (he has fastened an animal’s tail to the seat of his trousers), so that the part of the audi- ence that is behind him breaks out in laughter (the bishop is seated where he cannot see why the people are laughing) [X416].

|1829      Living Person Acts as Image of Saint [K1842]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) On a certain saint’s day, the saint’s statue is missing (it was broken during cleaning, sold, stolen). The sexton suggests to the clergyman that a shoemaker (tailor, beggar) who happens to look like the statue should stand in its place. The shoemaker agrees. Before the end of the service, however, he has to move (he sneezes or has to urinate, is bothered by insects, burns his foot on a candle). Often he curses. The statue’s coming to life is said to be a miracle. (2) A woodcarver who is supposed to carve a saint’s statue does not finish it on time. He finds someone who looks like the statue to take its place. A representative from the church comes and asks the woodcarver to alter the statue with a knife. The person taking its place becomes frightened and runs away. Cf. Types 1347, 1359C, 1572A*, and 1730.

|1830      Producing the Weather (previously In Trial Sermon the Parson Prom- ises the Laymen the Kind of Weather they Want). A congregation needs to appoint a new clergyman (sexton). They choose one who says he can produce whatever weather that they want. However, they cannot agree what the weather should be: one group wants rain, and another, sunshine. The new clergyman suggests that they let God decide what the weather should be (that it should be the same with the weather as it was before) [J1041.1]. Cf. Type 752B.

|1831      The Clergyman and Sexton at Mass. A clergyman tells his sexton (deacon) that he should steal a sheep (hog) during the service. When the sexton returns, the service is still going on. The clergyman asks him, as if it were part of the liturgy, whether his theft was successful. The sexton replies, also as if it were part of the service, that he got the sheep (that his theft was discovered), but that he lost the clergy man’s horse. Or, other dialogs on other subjects are incorporated into the lit- urgy, e.g. between the clergyman and his cook or between the sexton and the clergyman [X441]. 

Remarks: The conversation between the clergyman and the sexton is made to  
sound like the words used during the service: Latin word endings are used in a  
Catholic mass, or word endings are taken from Orthodox liturgy, etc.

|1832*      The Boy Answers the Clergyman. (Including the previous Types 1832A*, 1832C*, 1832G**, 1832H*, 1832J*, 1832K*, and 1835C*.) This mis cellaneous type consists of various anecdotes in which the clergy- man questions a boy during the service (in the street). The boy gives a quick-witted answer (which leaves the clergyman speech less). Cf. Type 1810.

The boy does not know, so he asks in return if the clergyman knows how many teeth a rake has (how much cloth can be made from a certain amount of flax, how to braid a straw hat). The clergyman does not know the answer, and the boy tells him that one person cannot know everything. To the question of the number of gods, a member of the congre- gation (farmer, child) answers a number that is too high. The clergy- man refuses to continue with the person’s confirmation (sends the person home). The candidate repeats the question to another person who tells him that there is only one God. The candidate cannot be- lieve that the clergyman would want so small a number as this for the answer. (Previously Type 1810A*.)

Or, the clergyman chooses a man to help with the service. The man thinks he has to repeat everything that the clergyman says, so he repeats the clergyman’s questions about what his name is and where he comes from [J2498.2]. Cf. Types 1246, 1694, 1694A, and 1821.

1832N*  Lamb of God Becomes Sheep of God. A man (boy, farmer, shepherd) comes to confession but does not know any prayers. The clergyman teaches him a short prayer that begins with the words, “Lamb of God”. Later the clergyman asks the man if he still remembers the prayer. The man begins with the words, “Sheep of God”. The clergy man asks why the man changed the word, and the man answers that the animal must have grown up in the meantime. In Arabian variants, the man is asked for his astrological sign and he answers, “Goat” (“Ram”). When he is asked to explain, he says that he was born in the sign of the Kid, but surely it must be grown up by now [J2212.6]. 
Remarks: Documented in 1526 in the jestbook A Hundred Mery Tales. The form  
with the astrological sign appears ca. 1200 in Ibn al-Ǧauzī, Aḫbār al-Ḥamqā.

|1832P*       “The Devil!” (Including the previous Type 1810C*.) The clergyman asks a boy in the confirmation class, “Who is the worst enemy of mankind?” The boy does not know the answer. For some other reason, another boy curses, “The devil!” The clergyman recognizes  this as the right answer. Or, a clergyman asks a question of a stupid person (asks him to read something). The person mumbles something about a fish. This is the right answer, and the person is praised for his intelligence. (Pre viously Type 1810C*.)

She wants to help him and asks him, “Who is the father of our miller’s sons?” – “Our miller”. Now the fool believes he knows the right answer. He goes back to the clergyman and says to him, “The father of Noah’s sons is our miller”. [J2713].

|1833      The Clergyman’s Rhetorical Question Misunderstood (previously Application of the Sermon). (Including the previous Type 1833**.) This miscellaneous type consists of various anecdotes in which a person (who arrives late to church) thinks that he has to answer a rhetorical question posed by the clergyman during the sermon [X435]. For example in some (German) variants, during the Easter ser- vice, the clergyman asks about the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24,13): “Who were these two who went there?” Someone in the congregation thinks he is asking about two men on the village street and answers, “Two butchers”. Or, the clergyman warns against dying while drunk, because such a person will be buried drunk and be drunk still on Judgment Day. A listener remarks that it must be powerful wine, since it makes one drunk for so long [cf. J1321.1]. 

Combinations: 1699, 1825. 
Remarks: The form with the warning against dying drunk was documented at  
the end of the 12th century as an Arabian anecdote.

|1833B     “Where is the Father?” (previously “Where Did Our Father Stay?”). A clergyman asks a boy (man) who the personages in the Trinity are (asks someone how he crosses himself or how he has baptized his child). The boy answers, “God the Son (Father) and the Holy Ghost” (“In the name of the Father and the Holy Ghost.”). The clergyman asks where the father (son) is, and the boy tells him where his own father is, e.g. holding the oxen (calf) or at home by the stove mending his clothes [X435.2].

|1833D     The Names of the Persons of the Holy Trinity. (Including the pre- vious Type 1832G*.) A clergyman wants to teach a boy (shepherd, cowherd) the names of the persons of the Holy Trinity (a prayer). To help him, the boy is to associate the names with three (four) animals (buttons on his jacket). Later, when the clergyman meets the boy and asks for the names, the boy cannot remember them all because one of the animals died (was sold, one of the buttons fell off) [X435.4]. Or, a farmer is supposed to associate the names of the Holy Trinity with members of his family, father, son, and wife. He refuses to do so because he is certain that the Holy Ghost is not such a spend thrift. Asked how many persons constitute the Holy Trinity and who they are, a boy answers, “Four”. He counts God the Father, his Son, the Holy Ghost, and Amen. (Previously Type 1832G*.)

|1833E     God is Dead (previously  God Died for You). An old woman (other member of the congregation, child) hears from the clergyman (other person) that Christ died for our sins (God is dead). She says she is sorry for the death, and that she did not know of it because she lives so far out in the country that she never gets any news. Then the old woman wonders about who God’s successor will be.

|1833F     The Same Old Story. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man goes to church on Good Friday (Christmas Eve) and hears the sermon. The next year, he goes again on that day (his son goes forty years later) and hears the same sermon. He complains that they are telling the same old story over again. (2) In Jewish variants, an old woman is so affected by the story of Joseph and his brothers that she stops eating and becomes ill. A year later she is recovered. She goes to the synagogue and hears the same text. She decides not to fall ill a second time.

|1833H     The Large Loaves. This miscellaneous tale exists chiefly in four dif- ferent forms: (1) A clergyman preaches about the miracle of the loaves and fishes, when 5000 people were fed with seven loaves and two fish. The congregation doubts whether this is possible. The clergyman ex- plains that the loaves were as big as mountains (houses). The people ask how big the ovens were [X434.1]. Cf. Type 1960K. (2) A clergyman reverses the number of loaves and people by mistake. Someone in the audience says that he could do that too. The following year, the clergyman gets it right and asks the congregation if they could do that. Someone says yes, because there would be leftovers from the previous year. (3) A clergyman says that God made the world in six months. He is corrected by the congregation but sticks to what he had said. (4) In variants from eastern Europe, a clergyman says that God made Adam out of clay and put him on a fence to dry. Someone in the congregation asks where the fence came from, since no one was there to have made it.

She answers that his voice (beard, face) reminded her of her recently-dead goat (donkey) [X436]. In some variants the woman answers that the clergyman re minds her of her son who is studying theology. She is crying because it is such a waste of money [cf. X426].

She gives him a little bag to hang around his neck. Inside the bag he finds his own message, and he laughs so hard that he recovers [N641] [J1513.1].

|1847*     Biblical Repartee. A man (Jew, robber, farmer) praises a sermon on the theme [Matthew 7,2], “If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him also”. He gives the clergyman a blow on the ear to see if he will act as the Bible recommends. Instead, the clergyman hits him back, quoting [Matthew 5,39], “With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more”. [J1262.3]. In some variants there are witnesses to the fight who say that both men are interpreting the Bible. Or, the fight is between a gentleman and a clergyman. The gentle - man hits the clergyman with a stick, saying, “This is Moses’ staff, with which he drew water out of the rock”. The clergyman draws a pistol and says, “This is Aaron’s holy censer”. [J1446]. Cf. Type 1811B.

|1848A     The Clergyman’s Calendar. (Including the previous Type 1848B.) A clergyman (Nasreddin Hodja) who cannot read the calendar puts beans (peas, grains of corn, pumpkin seeds) into his jacket pocket cor responding to the number of days in Lent (Ramadan). Each day he removes (eats) one bean (throws it in a pot). His wife (daughter) finds the beans and, thinking her husband likes them to eat, adds another handful. When the clergyman is asked how many more fast days there are, he counts the beans in his pocket and names an absurdly big number (says that Easter will not come this year; or, he finds colored eggshells and says that Easter is here already) [J2466.2]. Or, a clergyman makes a broom (wheel; collects a single egg) each day of the week so that he will know when Sunday comes. When he has six brooms, he tells the sexton to ring the bells on the follow- ing day. A neighbor (sexton) notices this scheme and hides one of the brooms, so that the clergyman makes a mistake and mis ses the service on Sunday.

In some variants from southeast Europe, a clergyman sits on the back of an unruly cow while his wife (farmhand) milks it. The cow runs away with the clergyman. Others ask him where he is going, and he replies, “Only God and this stupid cow know!” [J2132.3]. Cf. Type 1838.

|1860D     The Lawyer’s Letter Opened. Two farmers (neighbors) have an argu- ment (over their common boundary) and go to court to settle their dispute. They go one after the other to the same lawyer, who refers the second man to a colleague, giving him a letter. The farmer opens the letter and sees that the lawyer promises his colleague and himself a good profit. The farmer shows the letter to the other farm er, and they settle their dispute without legal help.

|1860E     Threshing Documents. A farmer has received a legal statement from a lawyer. When checking the document, for which he has to pay by the page, he realizes that the lawyer has written the paper with wide spaces between the lines (and that the last part of the page is blank). The lawyer explains that this is how documents have to be written. The farmer cannot pay the bill and offers to repay the lawyer with his own work. He takes revenge by threshing the lawyer’s grain (plowing his field), leaving wide spaces unthreshed between the rows. He explains that this is called “document-style threshing”.

|1861A     The Greater Bribe. In order to resolve their dispute, two men go to a judge. Before the judge makes his decision, one of the men brings him a wagon (ox, ax, jar of oil, milk, brass lamp). The other man brings him a horse (fur, cow or butter, sow, piglet, mule). The judge decides in favor of the second man. When the first man complains that his wagon went the wrong way, the judge explains that it went the way the horse pulled it [K441.2] (the fur stopped up the ox’s throat, the sow knocked over the oil jar, the piglet drank the milk, etc.) [J1192.1].

|1875      The Boy on the Bear’s (Wolf’s) Tail. A boy (man, girl, woman) be- comes lost (has run away from home or from his master, etc.). (In the forest,) he meets robbers (thieves, Gypsies, Indians) who put him into a cask. A wolf (fox, dog, bear) comes to eat the robbers’ leftovers (sniffs at the cask). The boy reaches out through a hole and seizes the animal by its tail (so that it cries out). It runs away dragging the cask behind it until the cask breaks. Often the boy discovers that he has been taken back home. (The animal loses its tail or is killed.) [X1133.3]. Cf. Types 1229, 1653, 1900. There is a northern group of variants in which a cabin boy an- noys the crew with his pranks (bad work, stupid conversation) or is blamed for a dangerous storm. The sailors throw him into the water in a cask along with some provisions (including honey) and tools. When he comes to a shore, he bores a hole and smears it with honey. Thus he lures a bear (fox, cow) and seizes its tail.

|1920A       “The Sea Burns.” Miscellaneous Type with diverse contents. Three main themes can be distinguished: (1) A man brags that he shot a single arrow through the hoof and the ear of a deer, so that the hoof remained stuck to the ear [N621]. When hearers doubt this account, another man (servant) corrobo rates the lie, explaining that the deer was scratching itself on the cheek and ear with its hoof, so the arrow went first through the hoof and then through the ear. (2) One man says that the sea is burning. The other says, “Then there will be plenty of roasted fish”. [X908]. (3) One man tells about a great turnip, another man about a great kettle to cook the turnip in. Cf. Types 1920E, 1931, 1960D, and 1960F.

|1920B     “I Have No Time to Lie.” A habitual liar is asked to tell a lie. He says he has no time for that now because he has to go to a neighboring town where there has been a huge catch of fish [X1150.1] (cf. Type 1960C) to buy some cheap (where children have fallen off the bridge into the water; or, his neighbor is sick and he has to get the doctor). Thus the liar induces his audience to go with him to the town, where they discover that the whole story was a lie [X905.4].

|1920J     Bridge Reduces a Lie. A boy (servant) who has just returned from a journey, travels on foot through the country with his father (knight). The boy tells a story about a dog (fox, cat, hare) that is bigger than (as big as) a horse (ox). Instead of scolding him for lying, the father tells him (1) that they will soon have to wade through a river that will swallow up anyone who has told a lie that day; or, (2) that they are coming to a bridge on which any liar will break his leg, or (3) which will fall to pieces if a liar crosses it.

|1927       The Cold May Night. During a very cold night in May, someone tells a man that long ago there was an even colder night. He goes on a journey to learn more about it. He meets an otter that has been lying on a rock in his cave for so long that his body has worn out the rock. The otter has heard of the cold night, but it was before his time. He sends the man to an eagle who has been sitting for so long on an anvil that the anvil is worn off away from the whetting of his beak on it. The eagle sends the man to an one-eyed salmon who remembers the cold night. As he was jumping out of the water, it froze beneath him, and he landed on the ice. After a bird came and picked his eye out, the salmon’s blood thawed the ice and he was able to swim again [B841, B124.1, X1620].

|1940       The Extraordinary Names. This miscellaneous type comprises vari- ous tales in which animals, people, or things are called by unusual names, which leads to confusion or disaster. The basis for the mis- understanding is either that the usual names have been switched (in humorous anecdotes) or that different names are adopted be cause of their symbolic, accoustic, or nonsense value (in cumulative tales, sayings, songs, and rhymes) [F703, X1506].

|1948       Too Much Talk. Three silent men (trolls, brothers, captains, farmers) withdraw from the world and retreat to a hermitage (canyon, monas- tery, island). After seven years, one of them speaks, “I think I heard a cow moo”. The others are irritated but stay silent. Seven years later, another man says, “It could have been an ox”. The third is annoyed but does not speak. After seven more years, he says, “I am leaving this place because there is too much talking (noise)”.

|1950      The Three Lazy Ones. A king wants to leave his kingdom to the lazi est of his three sons. Each boasts about his laziness [W111.1]. The first says that when he is lying down and drops of water fall in his eyes, he is too lazy to shut them [W111.1.3]. The second says that when he sits by the fire, if his foot starts to burn, he is too lazy to pull it back [W111.1.1]. The third says that if he were to be hanged and had a knife in his hand, he would be too lazy to use it to cut the rope [W111.1.2]. The father decides that the third is the laziest, and gives him the kingdom. In  another  form  of  the  tale,  five  sons  boast  of  their  laziness [W111.1]. The first is too lazy to close his mouth when he eats, so the birds carry off the bread. The second will not pull his leg out of the fire [W111.1.1]. The third lets mice gnaw on his ear. The fourth will not cut the rope used to hang him [W111.1.2]. The fifth lets raindrops beat his eyes out [W111.1.3].

The fish’s flesh is pickled in 300 pounds of salt, and it feeds an entire hospital for a year. The fish’s eyes alone weigh five pounds. Its scales are removed with a plow and used to roof a barn. Its bones are used to fence a field, and its skull is made into an oven. Cf. Type 1889G.

The following are the most common vari- ants: A turnip grows so big and so fast that the fence has to be moved three times during the summer. It takes a whole day to pull up the turnip, and seven days for a swallow to fly around it. A sow (hare) eats her way into the turnip, which grows back around her. When the turnip is cut open, the sow is found inside with seven piglets (seven cartloads of hares are found inside). Fifteen men uproot the turnip using levers, and two horses are needed to move it. A boat is made from its rind. The cabbage (mushroom) is so big that an entire regiment of sol- diers fits under its leaves (cap). Part of it is used to make soup for a battallion, but the rest of the vegetable is still too big to pass through the lock of the canal. Six men work for six weeks to dig up the potato, but they excav- ate only its top half. A stalk of rye is so fat that a hog can go through it, or a man can drive a horse and wagon through the stalk and turn around inside it. Five men can stand on its stump. One grain is so big that just cut ting it in two yields a bucket of sawdust. The tobacco is so tall that, to prune it, nine ladders have to be stack ed one on top of the other. It takes two men a whole day to cut out both sides of the stalk. Standing on the stump they fight for two days over the tobacco. Cf. Type 1920A.

|1960E     The Great Farmhouse. This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with an enormous farm, its separate buildings (house,  barn, kiln, granary, mill, church, etc.), or the management there [X1030–1036]. The following are the most common variants: A building is so tall that when an axe falls from the peak of the roof, a swallow is able to build her nest in it, lay her eggs, and rear her young, before the axe hits the floor. A barn is so long that when a cow is taken to the bull at the other end, she gives birth to her calf before she gets back to her stall. A church is so big that when a baby is baptized, he is old enough for his first communion before he comes out. A room is so big that, for three years, the father and mother look for each other inside it. On his way to his morning coffee, the farmer has to stop twice for meals. From the middle of the room the walls are not visible, so people have to use the floorboards to orient them- selves. Everything on the farmstead is enormous: buildings, animals, fields, tools, plants, catch of fish, oven, containers, cooking imple- ments, pipes, people, and cattle. The cows give so much milk that it flows out of the stall like an ocean, and someone in a boat has to float on it to skim the cream, etc.

|1960F     The Great Kettle [X1030.1.1]. It took ten (fifty, a hundred, etc.) smiths to forge the kettle. They stood so far apart as they worked that none of them could hear the others. Or, the enormous kettle belongs to a giant farmstead [X1031] (cf. Type 1960E) or giant ship (cf. Type 1960H). In the latter case, often either the cook or the ship itself, tossed in a storm, lands in the por- ridge pot and is mixed within the porridge. Cf. Type 1920A.

|1962       My Father’s Baptism (Wedding). A boy tells lies. For example, he claims that he was born before his father was born, baptized, or married. People send him to a mill (to climb up a sky-high tree) to get some flour (to find a witness for his parents’ marriage or a name or godfather in heaven). He harnesses six sacks of flour to the wagon and loads it with six oxen. When he arrives at the mill it is not there, but out picking strawberries. He finds the mill and drives it home. While he was gone, the handle of his whip has grown into a sky-high tree with birds’ nests in its branches. When he climbs up, the fledgling birds catch him and carry him away, and then drop him. He delivers the flour to his parents, dances with his mother at her wedding, and is born two years later. Cf. Type 1882.

|2014      Chains Involving Contradictions Or Extremes. (Including the previ- ous Type 2014A.) This miscellaneous type comprised of various chain tales that feature contradictions or extremes [Z51]. Cf. Types 1931, 2335. The following are the most common variants: (1) A man who has recently been married meets a friend (neigh- bor, stranger) who tells him what has happened at home while he was absent. The friend makes the events sound positive, but as the married man asks for more information, the situation turns out to be disasterous. (Previously Type 2014A.) During their conversation they exchange other news. For ex- ample, one says that a goat (hog) ate a giant cabbage and became fat enough to be slaughtered. Questions and answers follow, with com ments like, “That’s good.” – “No, not so good.” – “That’s bad.” – “No, not so bad.” One tells the other his house burned down. “That’s too bad”, answers the other, but the first man says, “Not it’s not so bad, because my wife died in the fire”. [Z51.1]. Cf. Type 2040. (2) Two godparents (strangers) discuss a coin (saw, pea) which one of them has found (lost). The conversation conveys alternating incidents or commentary. At the end, one tells the other that he killed a wolf which had eaten a wild boar. The other says, “That’s good”. The first replies, “Yes, it is good, but not very good, because the squire claimed its skin”.

|2023      Little Ant Marries (previously Little Ant Finds a Penny, Buys New Clothes with it, and Sits in her Doorway). An ant (beetle, cockroach, grasshopper, snail, cat, etc.) finds some money, buys new clothes, and sits in her doorway. Many animals come by and ask her to mar- ry them, in their characteristic voices. The ant chooses the mouse, because he is quiet. When the mouse stirs the stew (wedding soup), he falls in the pot and drowns. When the ant discovers this, she weeps. The bird tears his own beak off, the seagull tears his own tail off, etc. [Z32.3].

|2025      The Fleeing Pancake. A pancake (pudding, cake, cookie, cabbage strudel, round bread) jumps out of the pan (plate) and runs away from the cook (mother) who wants to eat it. The pancake runs out side and meets a series of animals (hen, rooster, duck, goose, fox, pig) or people who also want to eat it. The pancake runs away from all of them, bragging about all the others it has already escaped from. The fox (pig) induces the pancake to come close by pretending to be deaf, and gobbles it up [Z33.1]. The pig drops part of the pancake, so now all pigs root around in the mud looking for it.

|2028      The Devouring Animal That Was Cut Open (previously  The Troll [Wolf] who was Cut Open). (Including the previous Types 2027, 2027A, and 2028A*.) A cat (wolf, troll, mouse, giant, bear, chick, pump kin, woman, louse) with a huge appetite drinks a great quan- tity of milk, then eats a lot of food and devours the family with whom he lives. He goes out and people (animals) whom he meets on the road ask him why he is so fat (where he is going, why he is out so early). The cat lists everything he has eaten and announces that he will eat this person too. He devours everything he meets, e.g. certain animals, a cowherd, a flock of birds, a driver and his team of horses, etc. [Z33.2, Z33.3, Z33.4]. At the end, the cat bursts or meets an ox (someone else) he wants to eat which splits the cat’s belly open with its horn (a knife). Every- thing that the cat had eaten comes out alive. Cf. Types 123, 333. In some variants, a childless couple use clay to make a child who eats everything he meets.

|2030      The Old Woman and Her Pig. (Including the previous Types 2030A– H, 2030J, 2030A*–E*, 2034B, 2034E.) This miscellaneous type consists of various chain tales in which a person (animal) wants an animal (person, object) to do something (go home, pick pears, grow, get some beer, eat, reap grain). The animal refuses. The person threatens him by asking someone else (person, ani mal, object, or element: e.g. dog, stick, fire, water, butcher) for help. The request is not granted (the help is postponed until some de mand can be met). Finally someone (hangman, angel of death, ani mal) obliges, and all the others in succession do what the person had wanted them to [Z41, Z41.3, Z41.4, Z41.4.1, Z41.4.2, Z41.7, Z41.7.1, Z41.8, Z41.9]. In a few variants, a mouse eats cheese (wheat, wick of an eternal flame). A cat condemns the mouse and eats it as punishment; a dog eats the cat for eating the mouse. Each animal, object, or element is blamed for having damaged the one before it, and is then punished [Z41.1]. (Previously Type 2030C.)

The ice says this is not true, because the sun can melt it. The sun says it is not the strongest, because a cloud can obscure it. The cloud thinks a mountain is stronger. The mountain thinks grass or a mouse is stronger, the mouse thinks the cat is stronger, etc. (also fire, water, cattle, knive, butcher) [L392, Z42]. The cat (rat, God, human) is finally the strongest, or the question remains undecided.

|2031C     The Mightiest Being as Husband for the Daughter (previously The Man Seeks the Greatest Being as a Husband for his Daughter). A magician rescues a mouse (rat) which he transforms into a girl. Or, a childless couple wish for a child but instead have a mouse. The magician (parents) thinks the girl is the most beautiful creature in the world and wants to marry her to the mightiest husband. They ask the moon, who refuses and says the sun is brighter than he. The sun refuses because the clouds cover him. The clouds say the wind blows them. The wind says the mountain (castle) stops him. The mountain says a mouse digs inside him. The mouse is therefore the mightiest and becomes the daughter’s husband [L392].

|2032      The Healing of the Injured Animal (previously The Cock’s Whisk ers). (Including the previous Type 2032A.) An animal (mouse) is wounded (by another animal) and asks for help. He is told that this will happen only if he brings a particular object (fulfills some other request). The injured animal has to ask someone else for this object. This develops into a chain of demands and counter-requests, until finally someone (thing) agrees without a counter-request. The ani mal is treated for his injury, or else he dies before all the requests are granted [Z43]. In Spanish and Portuguese variants, a toad asks a magpie to throw something (a nut) down from a tree. The magpie is afraid its beak will break, but the toad promises to repair it. The beak breaks and the toad goes after horsehair to mend it. He is sent to fulfill other requests, until finally someone does not make a counter-re quest. Everyone in the chain gets what he or she wanted, and finally the toad brings the horsehair to the magpie [Z43.1.] (Previously Type 2032A.)

The mouse wants to get its tail back. The mouse asks the cat for its tail (the cobbler to sew its belly), but is told it must do something (e.g. bring milk from the goat or cow). The goat wants the mouse to give it grass, the meadow wants water, the well wants eggs, the chicken wants corn, etc. Finally some one complies and all the rest get what they want. Or, the mouse is eaten [Z41.4].
